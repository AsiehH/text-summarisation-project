"  Current matrix elements and observables for electro- and photo-excitation of baryons from the nucleon are studied in a light-front framework. Relativistic effects are estimated by comparison to a nonrelativistic model, where we use simple basis states to represent the baryon wavefunctions. Sizeable relativistic effects are found for certain transitions, for example, to radial excitations such as that conventionally used to describe to the Roper resonance. A systematic study shows that the violation of rotational covariance of the baryon transition matrix elements stemming from the use of one-body currents is generally small.

  We prove that the zeroth L^2-Betti number of a compact quantum group vanishes unless the underlying C*-algebra is finite dimensional and that the zeroth L^2-homology itself is non-trivial exactly when the quantum group is coamenable. ,On the zeroth L^2-homology of a quantum group
"  We investigate about the stability of generalized QCD ghost dark energy model against perturbations in the FRW background. For this purpose, we use the squared sound speed $v_s^2$ whose sign determines the stability of the model. We explore the stability of this model in the presence/absence of interaction between dark energy and dark matter in both flat and non-flat geometry. In all cases we find almost a same result. Based on the square sound speed analysis, due to the existence of a free parameter in this model, the model is theoretically capable to lead a dark energy dominated stable universe. However, observational constraints rule out such a chance. In conclusion, we find evidences that the generalized ghost dark energy might can not lead to a stable universe favored by observations at the present time.

"  We investigate the dynamical purification of maximally entangled electron states by transport through coupled quantum dots. Under resonant ac driving and coherent tunneling, even-parity Bell states perform Rabi oscillations that decouple from the environment, leading to a dark state. The two electrons remain spatially separated, one in each quantum dot. We propose configurations where this effect will prove as antiresonances in transport spectroscopy experiments.

"  In the field of cardio-thoracic surgery, valve function is monitored over time after surgery. The motivation for our research comes from a study which includes patients who received a human tissue valve in the aortic position. These patients are followed prospectively over time by standardized echocardiographic assessment of valve function. Loss of follow-up could be caused by valve intervention or the death of the patient. One of the main characteristics of the human valve is that its durability is limited. Therefore, it is of interest to obtain a prognostic model in order for the physicians to scan trends in valve function over time and plan their next intervention, accounting for the characteristics of the data.   Several authors have focused on deriving predictions under the standard joint modeling of longitudinal and survival data framework that assumes a constant effect for the coefficient that links the longitudinal and survival outcomes. However, in our case this may be a restrictive assumption. Since the valve degenerates, the association between the biomarker with survival may change over time.   To improve dynamic predictions we propose a Bayesian joint model that allows a time-varying coefficient to link the longitudinal and the survival processes, using P-splines. We evaluate the performance of the model in terms of discrimination and calibration, while accounting for censoring. ",Improved Dynamic Predictions from Joint Models of Longitudinal and   Survival Data with Time-Varying Effects using P-splines
  We use real replicas to investigate stability of thermodynamic homogeneity of the free energy of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model of spin glasses. Within the replica trick with the replica symmetric ansatz we show that the averaged free energy at low temperatures is not thermodynamically homogeneous. The demand of minimization of the inhomogeneity of thermodynamic potentials leads in a natural way to the hierarchical solution of the Parisi type. Conditions for the global thermodynamic homogeneity are derived and evaluated for the SK and $p$-spin infinite range models. ,Replica trick with real replicas: A way to build in thermodynamic   homogeneity
"  Recently, we have shown the advantages of two-way quantum communications in continuous variable quantum cryptography. Thanks to this new approach, two honest users can achieve a non-trivial security enhancement as long as the Gaussian interactions of an eavesdropper are independent and identical. In this work, we consider asymmetric strategies where the Gaussian interactions can be different and classically correlated. For several attacks of this kind, we prove that the enhancement of security still holds when the two-way protocols are used in direct reconciliation.

"  This letter develops an optimum beamforming method for downlink transmissions in cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, which employ a massive number of distributed access points to provide concurrent services to multiple users. The optimum design is formulated as a max-min problem that maximizes the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio of all users. It is shown analytically that the problem is quasi-concave, and the optimum solution is obtained with the second-order cone programming. The proposed method identifies the best achievable beamforming performance in cell-free massive MIMO systems. The results can be used as benchmarks for the design of practical low complexity beamformers. ",Max-Min Optimal Beamforming for Cell-Free Massive MIMO
"  The effects of perturbation of a weak periodic signal (WPS) assisted by noise or a high frequency signal (HFS) respectively on an excitable uni-junction transistor relaxation oscillator (UJT-RO) is presented here. When the perturbation by a WPS modulated with the noise is optimum, the UJT-RO has been observed to produce regular dynamics that mimics the WPS maximum, which is termed as stochastic resonance (SR). Interestingly, when the noise component is replaced by a HFS, the system shows the same SR kind of behavior, which is called vibrational resonance (VR). Here the system produces the dynamics that mimics the WPS resembling the SR assisted by the optimum level of HFS. Both SR and VR have been confirmed through PSPICE simulation. The results show that the regular dynamics that mimics the WPS in case of HFS modulation is better than the noise perturbation.

"  We discuss a model of dark matter consisting of high energy anti-electron-neutrinos with leptonic force, which is produced by the conserved leptonic charge $g_\ell$ associated with Lee-Yang's $U_1$ gauge symmetry. Based on particle-cosmology for early universe, the high energy neutrino (HEN) model of dark matter assumes that the neutron decay processes, $n\to p^+ + e^- +\ov{\nu}_e$, dominate the epoch after the creation, collision and confinement processes of quarks and antiquarks in the beginning. The HEN model implies the following results: There are almost equal numbers of electrons, protons and anti-electron-neutrinos dominated the matter cosmos. There are unobservable and ubiquitous anti-electron-neutrinos $\ov{\nu}_e$ with leptonic charge $g_\ell$ in the universe. Although the total mass of anti-electron-neutrino dark matter is negligible in the universe, its enhanced gravitational and leptonic forces could lead to the observed flat rotation curves due to relativistic $\ov{\nu}_e$, whose static force involves a factor $E_\nu/m_\nu\approx 10^6$. We estimate the leptonic charge to be $g_\ell \approx 7 \times 10^{-21}$. The model predicts that the anti-electron-neutrino dark matter can interact with cosmic-ray protons to produce positrons, i.e. $\ov{\nu}_e + p^+ \to e^+ +n$, through weak interaction of the unified electroweak theory. The anti-electron-neutrino dark matter sheds light on the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) experiment, which has detected the intriguing excess of cosmic-ray positrons over what is expected. The HEN model of dark matter suggests an experimental test of the new Lee-Yang force between electrons by using modern precision Cavendish experiment.

"  An RF-DC converter enhanced by a DC-DC voltage booster in silicon-on-insulator technology for UHF radio frequency identification (RFID) energy harvesting is presented in this letter. When the received RF power level is -14 dBm or higher, the system, fabricated on an FR4 substrate using off-the-shelf low-cost discrete components and connected to a flexible dipole antenna, is able to produce 2.4-V DC voltage to power general-purpose electronic devices. As a simple proof of concept,a device comprising microcontroller, temperature sensor, and EEPROM is considered in this work.

"  Using an appropriate notion of locally convex Kasparov modules, we show how to induce isomorphisms under a large class of functors on the category of locally convex algebras; examples are obtained from spectral triples. Our considerations are based on the action of algebraic K-theory on these functors, and involve compatibility properties of the induction process with this action, and with Kasparov-type products. This is based on an appropriate interpretation of the Connes-Skandalis connection formalism. As an application, we prove Bott periodicity and a Thom isomorphism for algebras of Schwartz functions.

"  We describe a representation for $U_q(\widehat{sl(n)})$, when $q$ is not a root of unity, based on the fundamental representation of $sl(n)$. As $U_q(sl(n))$ has a Hopf algebra structure with a non-commutative co-product, we look for a intertwine matrix $R$ that relates two possible definitions of that co-product. We solve cases for $n=2$ and $n=3$, and then we generalize for any $n$. We obtain the hamiltonian associated to such matrix $R$, corresponding to a multi-state chain. As the case for $n=2$ corresponds to the XXZ model with spin $1/2$, for $n>2$ we have the generalization of the XXZ model to $sl(n)$. We show the case for $n=3$ and its solution by Bethe ansatz.

"  We propose a simple mathematical model by applying Michaelis-Menton equations of enzyme kinetics to study the mutualistic interaction between the leaf cutter ant and its fungus garden at the early stage of colony expansion. We derive the sufficient conditions on the extinction and coexistence of these two species. In addition, we give a region of initial condition that leads to the extinction of two species when the model has an interior attractor. Our global analysis indicates that the division of labor by workers ants and initial conditions are two important {factors} that determine whether leaf cutter ants colonies and their fungus garden survive and grow can exist or not. We validate the model by doing the comparing between model simulations and data on fungal and ant colony growth rates under laboratory conditions. We perform sensitive analysis and parameter estimation of the model based on the experimental data to gain more biological insights on the ecological interactions between leaf cutter ants and their fungus garden. Finally, we give conclusions and {discuss} potential future {work}. ",Mathematical Modeling on Obligate Mutualism: Interactions between   leaf-cutter ants and their fungus garden
"  Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms have become powerful tools for Bayesian inference. However, they do not scale well to large-data problems. Divide-and-conquer strategies, which split the data into batches and, for each batch, run independent MCMC algorithms targeting the corresponding subposterior, can spread the computational burden across a number of separate workers. The challenge with such strategies is in recombining the subposteriors to approximate the full posterior. By creating a Gaussian-process approximation for each log-subposterior density we create a tractable approximation for the full posterior. This approximation is exploited through three methodologies: firstly a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm targeting the expectation of the posterior density provides a sample from an approximation to the posterior; secondly, evaluating the true posterior at the sampled points leads to an importance sampler that, asymptotically, targets the true posterior expectations; finally, an alternative importance sampler uses the full Gaussian-process distribution of the approximation to the log-posterior density to re-weight any initial sample and provide both an estimate of the posterior expectation and a measure of the uncertainty in it. ",Merging MCMC Subposteriors through Gaussian-Process Approximations
"  In this article, we propose a physical condition to extend interior isotropic solutions to anisotropic domains by gravitational decoupling in the framework of the Minimal Geometric Deformation approach. In particular, it is found that by using an expression reminiscent of the classical anisotropy factor, we can close the decoupling system of equations and a new anisotropic solution can be found. As an example, we extend the well--known Tolman IV. ",Beyond classical anisotropy and a new look to relativistic stars: a   gravitational decoupling approach
"  We report an experimental search for an exotic spin-spin-velocity-dependent interaction between polarized electrons of Rb atoms and polarized electrons of a solid-state mass, violating both the time-reversal and parity symmetries. This search targets a minute effective magnetic field induced by the interaction. A spin-exchange relaxation-free (SERF) magnetometer based on an optically polarized Rb vapor is the key element for both a source of polarized electrons and a high-sensitivity detector. A dysprosium iron garnet (DyIG) serves as the polarized mass, with an extremely small magnetization at the critical temperature around 240 K and a high spin density. To reduce the magnetization, one of major systematic effects, a home-built cooling system controls the mass temperature. To our knowledge, this is the first search for an exotic spin-dependent interaction using the compensated ferrimagnet DyIG as a polarized mass. The experiment set the most stringent limit on the electron-electron coupling strength in the centimeter interaction range, in particular $g_V^e g_V^e <10^{4}$ at $\lambda=2$ cm.

"  Obtaining general relations between macroscopic properties of random assemblies, such as density, and the microscopic properties of their constituent particles, such as shape, is a foundational challenge in the study of amorphous materials. By leveraging existing understanding of the random packing of spherical particles, we estimate the random packing density for all sufficiently spherical shapes. Our method uses the ensemble of random packing configurations of spheres as a reference point for a perturbative calculation, which we carry to linear order in the deformation. A fully analytic calculation shows that all sufficiently spherical shapes pack more densely than spheres. Additionally, we use simulation data for spheres to calculate numerical estimates for nonspherical particles and compare these estimates to simulations.

"  We study a geometric variational problem arising from modeling two-dimensional charged drops of a perfectly conducting liquid in the presence of an external potential. We characterize the semicontinuous envelope of the energy in terms of a parameter measuring the relative strength of the Coulomb interaction. As a consequence, when the potential is confining and the Coulomb repulsion strength is below a critical value, we show existence and partial regularity of volume-constrained minimizers. We also derive the Euler--Lagrange equation satisfied by regular critical points, expressing the first variation of the Coulombic energy in terms of the normal $\frac12$-derivative of the capacitary potential.

"  We report on Chandra and XMM-Newton observations of a sample of 13 quasars at z~4.7-5.4 mostly taken from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The present sample complements previous X-ray studies of z>4 quasars, in which the majority of the objects are optically more luminous and at lower redshifts. All but two of our quasars have been detected in the X-ray band, thus doubling the number of z>4.8 X-ray detected quasars. The two non-detections are likely to be due to a short exposure time and to the presence of intrinsic absorption. We confirm and extend to the highest redshifts the presence of a correlation between AB1450(1+z) magnitude and soft X-ray flux for z>4 quasars, and the presence of a steeper optical-to-X-ray spectral energy distribution (parameterized by aox) for high-luminosity, high-redshift quasars than for lower-luminosity, lower-redshift quasars. The second effect is likely due to the known anti-correlation between aox and rest-frame 2500 Angstrom luminosity, whose significance is confirmed via partial correlation analysis. The joint ~2.5-36 keV rest-frame spectrum of the z>4.8 SDSS quasars observed thus far by Chandra is well parameterized by a power-law with photon index Gamma=1.84+/-0.30; this photon index is consistent with those of z~0-3 quasars and that obtained from joint spectral fitting of z~4.1-4.5 optically luminous Palomar Digital Sky Survey quasars. No evidence for widespread intrinsic X-ray absorption has been found (Nh<4.0x10^{22} cm^{-2} on average at 90% confidence). We also obtained Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET) photometric observations for eight of our target quasars. None of these shows significant (>30%) optical variability over the time interval of a few years (in the observed frame) between the SDSS and HET observations.

"  Let $W$ be the Weyl group of a simply-laced affine Kac-Moody Lie group, excepting $\tilde{A}_n$ for $n$ even. We construct a multiple Dirichlet series $Z(x_1, \ldots x_{n+1})$, meromorphic in a half-space, satisfying a group $W$ of functional equations. This series is analogous to the multiple Dirichlet series for classical Weyl groups constructed by Brubaker-Bump-Friedberg, Chinta-Gunnells, and others. It is completely characterized by four natural axioms concerning its coefficients, axioms which come from the geometry of parameter spaces of hyperelliptic curves. The series constructed this way is optimal for computing moments of character sums and L-functions, including the fourth moment of quadratic L-functions at the central point via $\tilde{D}_4$ and the second moment weighted by the number of divisors of the conductor via $\tilde{A}_3$. We also give evidence to suggest that this series appears as a first Fourier-Whittaker coefficient in an Eisenstein series on the twofold metaplectic cover of the relevant Kac-Moody group. The construction is limited to the rational function field $\mathbb{F}_q(t)$, but it also describes the $p$-part of the multiple Dirichlet series over an arbitrary global field.

"  The superradiant instability modes of ultralight massive vector bosons are studied for weakly charged rotating black holes in Einstein--Maxwell gravity (the Kerr--Newman solution) and low-energy heterotic string theory (the Kerr--Sen black hole). We show that in both these cases, the corresponding massive vector (Proca) equations can be fully separated, exploiting the hidden symmetry present in these spacetimes. The resultant ordinary differential equations are solved numerically to find the most unstable modes of the Proca field in the two backgrounds and compared to the vacuum (Kerr black hole) case.

"  We investigate the spin and pseudospin symmetry in the single-particle resonant states by solving the Dirac equation containing a Woods-Saxon potential with Green's function method. Taking double-magic nucleus $^{208}$Pb as an example, three spin doublets $3d$, $2h$, and $1j$ and three pseudospin doublets $3\tilde{p}$, $1\tilde{i}$, and $1\tilde{j}$ are obtained for the single-neutron resonant states. By analyzing the energy splittings, we find that the threshold effect plays an important role in resonant pseudospin doubles. Besides, there is a reversed level structure of pseudospin doublets in the continuum. Differently, all the width splittings of either the spin doublets or the pseudospin doublets are systematically positive and the splittings are very small except $1\tilde{j}$ doublet. Further studies show that the splittings of the energies and widths for the resonant (pseudo)spin doublets are independent. Besides, the similarity properties of the wave functions of the spin and pseudospin doublets still maintain well in resonant states.

"  A measurement of the top quark mass using events with one charged lepton, missing transverse energy, and jets in the final state, collected by the D0 detector from p-pbar collisions at sqrt{s} = 1.96 TeV at the Fermilab Tevatron collider, is presented. A constrained fit is used to fully reconstruct the kinematics of the events. For every event a top quark mass likelihood is calculated taking into account all possible jet assignments and the probability that an event is signal or background. Lifetime-based identification of b jets is employed to enhance the separation between t-tbar signal and background from other physics processes and to improve the assignment of the observed jets to the quarks in the t-tbar hypothesis. We extract a multiplicative jet energy scale factor JES in-situ, greatly reducing the systematic effect related to the jet energy measurement. In a data sample with an integrated luminosity of 425 pb-1, we observe 230 candidate events, with an estimated background of 123 events, and measure m_t = 173.7 +-4.4 (stat + JES) +2.1/-2.0 (syst) GeV.

"  We report a first-principles study on the tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) and spin-injection efficiency (SIE) through phosphorene with nickel electrodes under the mechanical tension and bending on the phosphorene region. Both the TMR and SIE are largely improved under these mechanical deformations. For the uniaxial tension ($\varepsilon_y$) varying from 0 to 15\% applied along the armchair transport ({\it y}-)direction of the phosphorene, the TMR ratio is enhanced with a maximum of 107\% at the $\varepsilon_y=10\%$, while the SIE increases monotonously from 8\% up to 43\% with the increasing of the strain. Under the out-of-plane bending, the TMR overall increases from 7\% to 50\% within the bending ratio of 0-3.9\%, and meanwhile the SIE is largely improved to around 70\%, as compared to that (30\%) of the flat phosphorene. Such behaviors of the TMR and SIE are mainly affected by the transmission of spin-up electrons in the parallel configuration, which is highly depended on the applied mechanical tension and bending. Our results indicate that the phosphorene based tunnel junctions have promising applications in flexible electronics. ",Spin-polarized quantum transport properties through flexible phosphorene
"  Here we present an open source Python-based Bayesian orbit retrieval code (Nii) that implements an automatic parallel tempering Markov chain Monte Carlo (APT-MCMC) strategy. Nii provides a module to simulate the observations of a space-based astrometry mission in the search for exoplanets, a signal extraction process for differential astrometric measurements using multiple reference stars, and an orbital parameter retrieval framework using APT-MCMC. We further verify the orbit retrieval ability of the code through two examples corresponding to a single-planet system and a dual-planet system. In both cases, efficient convergence on the posterior probability distribution can be achieved. Although this code specifically focuses on the orbital parameter retrieval problem of differential astrometry, Nii can also be widely used in other Bayesian analysis applications.

"  We analyze the spectrum of open strings stretched between a D-brane and an anti-D-brane in planar AdS/CFT using various tools. We focus on open strings ending on two giant gravitons with different orientation in $AdS_5 \times S^5$ and study the spectrum of string excitations using the following approaches: open spin-chain, boundary asymptotic Bethe ansatz and boundary thermodynamic Bethe ansatz (BTBA). We find agreement between a perturbative high order diagrammatic calculation in ${\cal N}=4$ SYM and the leading finite-size boundary Luscher correction. We study the ground state energy of the system at finite coupling by deriving and numerically solving a set of BTBA equations. While the numerics give reasonable results at small coupling, they break down at finite coupling when the total energy of the string gets close to zero, possibly indicating that the state turns tachyonic. The location of the breakdown is also predicted analytically. ",The spectrum of tachyons in AdS/CFT
"  Logistic models are commonly used for binary classification tasks. The success of such models has often been attributed to their connection to maximum-likelihood estimators. It has been shown that gradient descent algorithm, when applied on the logistic loss, converges to the max-margin classifier (a.k.a. hard-margin SVM). The performance of the max-margin classifier has been recently analyzed. Inspired by these results, in this paper, we present and study a more general setting, where the underlying parameters of the logistic model possess certain structures (sparse, block-sparse, low-rank, etc.) and introduce a more general framework (which is referred to as ""Generalized Margin Maximizer"", GMM). While classical max-margin classifiers minimize the $2$-norm of the parameter vector subject to linearly separating the data, GMM minimizes any arbitrary convex function of the parameter vector. We provide a precise analysis of the performance of GMM via the solution of a system of nonlinear equations. We also provide a detailed study for three special cases: ($1$) $\ell_2$-GMM that is the max-margin classifier, ($2$) $\ell_1$-GMM which encourages sparsity, and ($3$) $\ell_{\infty}$-GMM which is often used when the parameter vector has binary entries. Our theoretical results are validated by extensive simulation results across a range of parameter values, problem instances, and model structures.

"  Weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) are one of very few probes of cosmology before Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN). We point out that in scenarios in which the Universe evolves in a non-standard manner during and after WIMP kinetic decoupling, the horizon mass scale at decoupling can be smaller and the dark matter WIMPs can be colder than in standard cosmology. This would lead to much smaller first objects in hierarchical structure formation. In low reheating temperature scenarios the effect may be large enough as to noticeably enhance indirect detection signals in GLAST and other detectors, by up to two orders of magnitude.

"  In this paper we study the problem of social learning under multiple true hypotheses and self-interested agents which exchange information over a graph. In this setup, each agent receives data that might be generated from a different hypothesis (or state) than the data other agents receive. In contrast to the related literature in social learning, which focuses on showing that the network achieves consensus, here we study the case where every agent is self-interested and wants to find the hypothesis that generates its own observations. However, agents do not know which ones of their peers wants to find the same state with them and as a result they do not know which agents they should cooperate with. To this end, we propose a scheme with adaptive combination weights and study the consistency of the agents' learning process. The scheme allows each agent to identify and collaborate with neighbors that observe the same hypothesis, while excluding others, thus resulting in improved performance compared to both non-cooperative learning and cooperative social learning solutions. We analyze the asymptotic behavior of agents' beliefs under the proposed social learning algorithm and provide sufficient conditions that enable all agents to correctly identify their true hypotheses. The theoretical analysis is corroborated by numerical simulations. ",Self-aware Social Learning over Graphs

"  We investigate a lattice-fluid model defined on a two-dimensional triangular lattice, with the aim of reproducing qualitatively some anomalous properties of water. Model molecules are of the ""Mercedes Benz"" type, i.e., they possess a D3 (equilateral triangle) symmetry, with three bonding arms. Bond formation depends both on orientation and local density. We work out phase diagrams, response functions, and stability limits for the liquid phase, making use of a generalized first order approximation on a triangle cluster, whose accuracy is verified, in some cases, by Monte Carlo simulations. The phase diagram displays one ordered (solid) phase which is less dense than the liquid one. At fixed pressure the liquid phase response functions show the typical anomalous behavior observed in liquid water, while, in the supercooled region, a reentrant spinodal is observed.

"  Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric condition affecting nearly a quarter of the United States war veterans who return from war zones. Treatment for PTSD typically consists of a combination of in-session therapy and medication. However; patients often experience their most severe PTSD symptoms outside of therapy sessions. Mobile health applications may address this gap, but their effectiveness is limited by the current gap in continuous monitoring and detection capabilities enabling timely intervention. The goal of this article is to develop a novel method to detect hyperarousal events using physiological and activity-based machine learning algorithms. Physiological data including heart rate and body acceleration as well as self-reported hyperarousal events were collected using a tool developed for commercial off-the-shelf wearable devices from 99 United States veterans diagnosed with PTSD over several days. The data were used to develop four machine learning algorithms: Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression and XGBoost. The XGBoost model had the best performance in detecting onset of PTSD symptoms with over 83% accuracy and an AUC of 0.70. Post-hoc SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) additive explanation analysis showed that algorithm predictions were correlated with average heart rate, minimum heart rate and average body acceleration.

"  Single Helical Axis (SHAx) configurations are emerging as the natural state for high current reversed field pinch (RFP) plasmas. These states feature the presence of transport barriers in the core plasma. Here we present a method for computing the equilibrium magnetic surfaces for these states in the force-free approximation, which has been implemented in the SHEq code. The method is based on the superposition of a zeroth order axisymmetric equilibrium and of a first order helical perturbation computed according to Newcomb's equation supplemented with edge magnetic field measurements. The mapping of the measured electron temperature profiles, soft X-ray emission and interferometric density measurements on the computed magnetic surfaces demonstrates the quality of the equilibrium reconstruction. The procedure for computing flux surface averages is illustrated, and applied to the evaluation of the thermal conductivity profile. The consistency of the evaluated equilibria with Ohm's law is also discussed. ",Equilibrium reconstruction for Single Helical Axis reversed field pinch   plasmas
"  We study Pandharipande-Thomas's stable pair theory on $K3$ fibrations over curves with possibly nodal fibers. We describe stable pair invariants of the fiberwise irreducible curve classes in terms of Kawai-Yoshioka's formula for the Euler characteristics of moduli spaces of stable pairs on $K3$ surfaces and Noether-Lefschetz numbers of the fibration. Moreover, we investigate the relation of these invariants with the perverse (non-commutative) stable pair invariants of the $K3$ fibration. In the case that the $K3$ fibration is a projective Calabi-Yau threefold, by means of wall-crossing techniques, we write the stable pair invariants in terms of the generalized Donaldson-Thomas invariants of 2-dimensional Gieseker semistable sheaves supported on the fibers.

"  Protein collapse can be viewed as a dynamical phase transition, during which new scales and collective variables become excited while the old ones recede and fade away. This causes formidable computational bottle-necks in approaches that are based on atomic scale scrutiny. Here we consider an effective dynamical Landau theory to model the folding process at biologically relevant time and distance scales. We reach both a substantial decrease in the execution time and improvement in the accuracy of the final configuration, in comparison to more conventional approaches. As an example we inspect the collapse of HP35 chicken villin headpiece subdomain, where there are detailed molecular dynamics simulations to compare with. We start from a structureless, unbend and untwisted initial configuration. In less than one second of wall-clock time on a single processor personal computer we consistently reach the native state with 0.5 Angstrom root mean square distance (RMSD) precision. We confirm that our folding pathways are indeed akin those obtained in recent atomic level molecular dynamics simulations. We conclude that our approach appears to have the potential for a computationally economical method to accurately understand theoretical aspects of protein collapse.

"  Time course data are often used to study the changes to a biological process after perturbation. Statistical methods have been developed to determine whether such a perturbation induces changes over time, e.g. comparing a perturbed and unperturbed time course dataset to uncover differences. However, existing methods do not provide a principled statistical approach to identify the specific time when the two time course datasets first begin to diverge after a perturbation; we call this the perturbation time. Estimation of the perturbation time for different variables in a biological process allows us to identify the sequence of events following a perturbation and therefore provides valuable insights into likely causal relationships.   In this paper, we propose a Bayesian method to infer the perturbation time given time course data from a wild-type and perturbed system. We use a non-parametric approach based on Gaussian Process regression. We derive a probabilistic model of noise-corrupted and replicated time course data coming from the same profile before the perturbation time and diverging after the perturbation time. The likelihood function can be worked out exactly for this model and the posterior distribution of the perturbation time is obtained by a simple histogram approach, without recourse to complex approximate inference algorithms. We validate the method on simulated data and apply it to study the transcriptional change occurring in Arabidopsis following inoculation with P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 versus the disarmed strain DC3000hrpA.   An R package, DEtime, implementing the method is available at https://github.com/ManchesterBioinference/DEtime along with the data and code required to reproduce all the results.

"  In this paper we propose indirect probes of the scale of supersymmetry breaking, through observations in the Extreme Universe Space Observatory onboard Japanese Experiment Module (JEM-EUSO). We consider scenarios where the lightest supersymmetric particle is the gravitino, and the next to lightest (NLSP) is a long lived slepton. We demonstrate that JEM-EUSO will be able to probe models where the NLSP decays, therefore probing supersymmetric breaking scales below $5 \times 10^6$ GeV. The observatory field of view will be large enough to detect a few tens of events per year, depending on its energy threshold. This is complementary to a previous proposal (Albuquerque et al., 2004) where it was shown that 1 Km$^3$ neutrino telescopes can directly probe this scale. NLSPs will be produced by the interaction of high energy neutrinos in the Earth. Here we investigate scenarios where they subsequently decay, either in the atmosphere after escaping the Earth or right before leaving the Earth, producing taus. These can be detected by JEM-EUSO and have two distinctive signatures: one, they are produced in the Earth and go upwards in the atmosphere, which allows discrimination from atmospheric taus and, second, as NLSPs are always produced in pairs, coincident taus will be a strong signature for these events. Assuming that the neutrino flux is equivalent to the Waxman-Bahcall limit, we determine the rate of taus from NLSP decays reaching JEM-EUSO's field of view.

"  Let $p(\cdot):\mathbb R^n\rightarrow(0,\infty)$ be a variable exponent function satisfying the globally log-H\""older continuous condition. In this paper, we obtain the boundedness of para-product operators $\pi_b$ on variable Hardy spaces $H^{p(\cdot)}(\mathbb R^n)$, where $b\in BMO(\mathbb R^n)$. As an application, we show that non-convolution type Calder\'on-Zygmund operators $T$ are bounded on $H^{p(\cdot)}(\mathbb R^n)$ if and only if $T^\ast1=0$, where $\frac{n}{n+\epsilon}<\mbox{essinf}_{x\in\mathbb R^n} p\le \mbox{esssup}_{x\in\mathbb R^n} p\le 1$, $\epsilon$ is the regular exponent of kernel of $T$. Our approach relies on the discrete version of Calder\'on's reproducing formula, discrete Littlewood-Paley-Stein theory and almost orthogonal estimates. These results still hold for variable Hardy space on spaces of homogeneous type by using our methods. ",Discrete para-product operators on variable Hardy spaces

We calculate the impurity susceptibility using a quantum Monte Carlo method. With intra-layer couplings in only one of the layers (Kondo lattice), we observe an anomalous Curie constant C*, as predicted on the basis of field-theoretical work [S. Sachdev et al., Science 286, 2479 (1999)]. The value C*=0.262 +/- 0.002 is larger than the normal Curie constant C=S(S+1)/3.

"  Fluctuations of the number of condensed atoms in a finite-size, weakly interacting Bose gas confined in a box potential are investigated for temperatures up to the critical region. The canonical partition functions are evaluated using a recursive scheme for smaller systems, and a saddle-point approximation for larger samples, that allows to treat realistic size systems containing up to $N \sim 10^5$ particles. We point out the importance of particle-number constrain and interactions between out of condensate atoms for the statistics near the critical region. For sufficiently large systems the crossover from the anomalous to normal scaling of the fluctuations is observed. The excitations are described in a self-consistent way within the Bogoliubov-Popov approximation, and the interactions between thermal atoms are described by means of the Hartree-Fock method.

"  We give a thorough description of the shape of rotating axisymmetric stable black-hole (apparent) horizons applicable in dynamical or stationary regimes. It is found that rotation manifests in the widening of their central regions (rotational thickening), limits their global shapes to the extent that stable holes of a given area A and angular momentum J (non zero) form a precompact family (rotational stabilization) and enforces their whole geometry to be close to the extreme-Kerr horizon geometry at almost maximal rotational speed (enforced shaping). The results, which are based on the stability inequality, depend only on A and J. In particular they are entirely independent of the surrounding geometry of the space-time and of the presence of matter satisfying the strong energy condition. A complete set of relations between A, J, the length L of the meridians and the length R of the greatest axisymmetric circle, is given. We also provide concrete estimations for the distance between the geometry of horizons and that of the extreme Kerr, in terms only of A and J. Besides it own interest, the work has applications to the Hoop conjecture as formulated by Gibbons in terms of the Birkhoff invariant, to the Bekenstein-Hod entropy bounds and to study the compactness of classes of stationary black-hole space-times.

"  We theoretically investigate the size-, shape-, and composition-dependent polarizabilities of the SimCn (m, n = 1 - 4) clusters by using the density functional based coupled perturbed Hartree-Fock method. The size-dependence of the polarizabilities of the SimCn (m, n = 1 - 4) clusters is more complicated than that of pure Sim and Cn (m, n = 1 - 8) clusters because for a given cluster size the heteroatomic clusters have more isomers than the homoatomic ones. For the shape-dependence, we consider three kinds of shape, linear (chain), prolate, and compact. For most clusters, we can clearly observe orders of {\alpha}(linear) > {\alpha}(prolate) and {\alpha}(prolate) > {\alpha}(compact) for a given composition. The composition-dependence of polarizabilities reveals that the linear clusters have an obvious larger polarizability than both the prolate and the compact clusters especially for a given m/n value. The shape effect makes a main contribution to determine the size of the polarizability. To understand the size of polarizability and the evolution of polarizability, we have tried many factors, such as the energy gap and binding energy, and defined a new parameter ({\Delta}q) that characterizes the redistribution of charge in cluster. We find that both the binding energy and the {\Delta}q are more available than the energy gap for reflecting the evolution of polarizabilities provided that both the cluster shape and one of the components in cluster are fixed. The correlation between the polarizability and the energy gap is poor, in agreement with the previous results.

"  Labeled state-to-function transition systems, FuTS for short, are characterized by transitions which relate states to functions of states over general semirings, equipped with a rich set of higher-order operators. As such, FuTS constitute a convenient modeling instrument to deal with process languages and their quantitative extensions in particular. In this paper, the notion of bisimulation induced by a FuTS is addressed from a coalgebraic point of view. A correspondence result is established stating that FuTS-bisimilarity coincides with behavioural equivalence of the associated functor. As generic examples, the equivalences underlying substantial fragments of major examples of quantitative process algebras are related to the bisimilarity of specific FuTS. The examples range from a stochastic process language, PEPA, to a language for Interactive Markov Chains, IML, a (discrete) timed process language, TPC, and a language for Markov Automata, MAL. The equivalences underlying these languages are related to the bisimilarity of their specific FuTS. By the correspondence result coalgebraic justification of the equivalences of these calculi is obtained. The specific selection of languages, besides covering a large variety of process interaction models and modelling choices involving quantities, allows us to show different classes of FuTS, namely so-called simple FuTS, combined FuTS, nested FuTS, and general FuTS.

"  We study flavour issues in nonsupersymmetric intersecting brane models. Specifically, the purpose of the present paper is twofold: (i) to determine whether realistic flavour structures can be obtained in these models, and (ii) to establish whether the non-supersymmetric models address the gauge hierarchy problem. To this end, we find that realistic flavour structures, although absent at tree level, can arise even in the simplest models after effects of 4 fermion instanton--induced operators and radiative corrections have been taken into account. On the other hand, our analysis of flavour changing neutral currents (FCNC), electric dipole moments (EDM), supernova SN1987A and other constraints shows that the string scale has to be rather high, 10^4 TeV. This implies that non-supersymmetric intersecting brane models face a severe finetuning problem. Finally, we comment on how non--trivial flavour structures can arise in supersymmetric models.

"  The Apollonian circle packing, generated from three mutually-tangent circles in the plane, has inspired over the past half-century the study of other classes of space-filling packings, both in two and in higher dimensions. Recently, Kontorovich and Nakamura introduced the notion of crystallographic sphere packings, $n$-dimensional packings of spheres with symmetry groups that are isometries of $\mathbb{H}^{n+1}$. There exist at least three sources which give rise to crystallographic packings, namely polyhedra, reflective extended Bianchi groups, and various higher dimensional quadratic forms. When applied in conjunction with the Koebe-Andreev-Thurston Theorem, Kontorovich and Nakamura's Structure Theorem guarantees crystallographic packings to be generated from polyhedra in $n=2$. The Structure Theorem similarly allows us to generate packings from the reflective extended Bianchi groups in $n=2$ by applying Vinberg's algorithm to obtain the appropriate Coxeter diagrams. In $n>2$, the Structure Theorem when used with Vinberg's algorithm allows us to explore whether certain Coxeter diagrams in $\mathbb{H}^{n+1}$ for a given quadratic form admit a packing at all. Kontorovich and Nakamura's Finiteness Theorem shows that there exist only finitely many classes of superintegral such packings, all of which exist in dimensions $n\le20$. In this work, we systematically determine all known examples of crystallographic sphere packings. ",A Taxonomy of Crystallographic Sphere Packings

Through this method, one may have access to the same effective mass $m^2_\beta$ extractable from the tritium beta decay experiments for electron neutrinos as well as the analogous effective mass $(m^2_{\nu_\mu})_{\rm eff}$ for muon neutrinos. In the channel $\pi^-\to e^-\bar{\nu}$, the relative probability of producing an antineutrino with left helicity is enhanced if compared with the naive expectation $(m_\nu/2E_\nu)^2$.

In our study, we adress the Kitaev chain, a one-dimensional chain of atoms deposited on top of a p-wave superconductor that induces superconductivity in the chain by proximity effect. We establish a correspondence between the Kitaev chain and a tight-binding lattice with a particular geometry for a particular case of the system parameters.

"  We consider a version of the notion of F-inverse semigroup (studied in the algebraic theory of inverse semigroups).

This cohomology naturally arises in the Morse-Novikov theory. We show that for a solvable Lie group $G$ with a completely solvable Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ and a cocompact lattice $\Gamma \subset G$ the cohomology $H^*_{\lambda \omega}(G/\Gamma, {\mathbb C})$ coincides with the cohomology $H^*_{\lambda \omega}(\mathfrak{g})$ of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ associated with the one-dimensional representation $\rho_{\lambda \omega}: \mathfrak{g} \to {\mathbb K}, \rho_{\lambda \omega}(\xi) = \lambda \omega(\xi)$. Moreover $H^*_{\lambda \omega}(G/\Gamma, {\mathbb C})$ is non-trivial if and only if $-\lambda [\omega]$ belongs to the finite subset $\{0\} \cup \tilde \Omega_{\mathfrak{g}}$ in $H^1(G/\Gamma, {\mathbb C})$ well defined in terms of $\mathfrak{g}$.

"  An optimization for multilayered nanotubes that minimizes the scattering efficiency for a given polarization is derived. The cylindrical nanocavities have a radially periodic distribution, and the marginal layers that play a crucial role particularly in the presence of nonlocalities are disposed to reduce the scattering efficiency up to two orders of magnitude in comparison with previous proposals. The predominant causes leading to such invisibility effect are critically discussed. A transfer-matrix formalism is additionally developed for the fast estimation of the scattering efficiency of the nanostructures.

The extra terms in the modified Einstein equations generate an equivalent mass term (geometrical mass), which give an effective contribution to the gravitational energy and offer viable explanation to account for the virial mass discrepancy in clusters of galaxies. We also obtain the radial velocity dispersion of galaxy clusters and show that it is compatible with the radial velocity dispersion profile of such clusters. Finally, we compare the result of the model with L(R) gravity theories. ",Virial mass in warped DGP-inspired L(R) gravity

"  The analyticity properties of the scattering amplitude for a massive scalar field is reviewed in this article where the spacetime geometry is $R^{3,1}\otimes S^1$ i.e. one spatial dimension is compact. Khuri investigated the analyticity of scattering amplitude in a nonrelativitstic potential model in three dimensions with an additional compact dimension. He showed that, under certain circumstances, the forward amplitude is nonanalytic. He argued that in high energy scattering if such a behaviour persists it would be in conflicts with the established results of quantum field theory and LHC might observe such behaviors. We envisage a real scalar massive field in flat Minkowski spacetime in five dimensions. The Kaluza-Klein (KK) compactification is implemented on a circle. The resulting four dimensional manifold is $R^{3,1}\otimes S^1$. The LSZ formalism is adopted to study the analyticity of the scattering amplitude. The nonforward dispersion relation is proved. In addition the Jin-Martin bound and an analog of the Froissart-Martin bound are proved. A novel proposal is presented to look for evidence of the large-radius-compactification scenario. A seemingly violation of Froissart-Martin bound at LHC energy might hint that an extra dimension might be decompactified. However, we find no evidence for violation of the bound in our analysis.

"  Two-dimensional van der Waals compounds with magnetic ions on a honeycomb lattice are hosts to a variety of exotic behavior. The magnetic interactions in one such compound, MnPSe$_3$, are investigated with elastic and inelastic neutron scattering.

The inelastic neutron scattering results allow a model spin Hamiltonian to be presented that includes dominant intralayer interactions of $J_{1ab}$=0.45 meV, $J_{2ab}$=0.03 meV, $J_{3ab}$=0.19 meV, and appreciable interlayer interactions of $J_c$=0.031(5) meV. No evidence for anisotropy in the form of a spin-gap is observed in the data collected.

"  The distribution $N(x)$ of citations of scientific papers has recently been illustrated (on ISI and PRE data sets) and analyzed by Redner [Eur. Phys. J. B {\bf 4}, 131 (1998)]. To fit the data, a stretched exponential ($N(x) \propto \exp{-(x/x_0)^{\beta}}$) has been used with only partial success. The success is not complete because the data exhibit, for large citation count $x$, a power law (roughly $N(x) \propto x^{-3}$ for the ISI data), which, clearly, the stretched exponential does not reproduce. This fact is then attributed to a possibly different nature of rarely cited and largely cited papers. We show here that, within a nonextensive thermostatistical formalism, the same data can be quite satisfactorily fitted with a single curve (namely, $N(x) \propto 1/[1+(q-1) \lambda x]^{q/{q-1}}$ for the available values of $x$. This is consistent with the connection recently established by Denisov [Phys. Lett. A {\bf 235}, 447 (1997)] between this nonextensive formalism and the Zipf-Mandelbrot law. What the present analysis ultimately suggests is that, in contrast to Redner's conclusion, the phenomenon might essentially be one and the same along the entire range of the citation number $x$.

"  Seismic inversion and imaging are adjoint-based optimization problems that process up to terabytes of data, regularly exceeding the memory capacity of available computers. Data compression is an effective strategy to reduce this memory requirement by a certain factor, particularly if some loss in accuracy is acceptable. A popular alternative is checkpointing, where data is stored at selected points in time, and values at other times are recomputed as needed from the last stored state. This allows arbitrarily large adjoint computations with limited memory, at the cost of additional recomputations.   In this paper, we combine compression and checkpointing for the first time to compute a realistic seismic inversion. The combination of checkpointing and compression allows larger adjoint computations compared to using only compression, and reduces the recomputation overhead significantly compared to using only checkpointing.

"  In $M$-estimation under standard asymptotics, the weak convergence combined with the polynomial type large deviation estimate of the associated statistical random field Yoshida (2011) provides us with not only the asymptotic distribution of the associated $M$-estimator but also the convergence of its moments, the latter playing an important role in theoretical statistics. In this paper, we study the above program for statistical random fields of multiple and also possibly mixed-rates type in the sense of Radchenko (2008) where the associated statistical random fields may be non-differentiable and may fail to be locally asymptotically quadratic. Consequently, a very strong mode of convergence of a wide range of regularized $M$-estimators is ensured. The results are applied to regularized estimation of an ergodic diffusion observed at high frequency. ",Moment convergence in regularized estimation under multiple and   mixed-rates asymptotics

"  Instrumental variable methods are popular choices in combating unmeasured confounding to obtain less biased effect estimates. However, we demonstrate that alternative methods may give less biased estimates depending on the nature of unmeasured confounding. Treatment preferences of clusters (e.g., physician practices) are the most f6requently used instruments in instrumental variable analyses (IVA). These preference-based IVAs are usually conducted on data clustered by region, hospital/facility, or physician, where unmeasured confounding often occurs within or between clusters. We aim to quantify the impact of unmeasured confounding on the bias of effect estimators in IVA, as well as alternative methods including ordinary least squares regression, linear mixed models (LMM) and fixed effect models (FE) to study the effect of a continuous exposure (e.g., treatment dose). We derive bias formulae of estimators from these four methods in the presence of unmeasured within- and/or between-cluster confounders. We show that IVAs can provide consistent estimates when unmeasured within-cluster confounding exists, but not when between-cluster confounding exists. On the other hand, FEs and LMMs can provide consistent estimates when unmeasured between-cluster confounding exits, but not for within-cluster confounding. Whether IVAs are advantageous in reducing bias over FEs and LMMs depends on the extent of unmeasured within-cluster confounding relative to between-cluster confounding. Furthermore, the impact of unmeasured between-cluster confounding on IVA estimates is larger than the impact of unmeasured within-cluster confounding on FE and LMM estimates. We illustrate these methods through data applications. Our findings provide guidance for choosing appropriate methods to combat the dominant types of unmeasured confounders and help interpret statistical results in the context of unmeasured confounding ","The Impact of Unmeasured Within- and Between-Cluster Confounding on the   Bias of Effect Estimators from Fixed Effect, Mixed effect and Instrumental   Variable Models"

"  We study the effects of Coulomb interaction and inter-grain quantum tunnelling in an array of metallic grains using the phase-functional approach for temperatures $T$ well below the charging energy $E_{c}$ of individual grains yet large compared to the level spacing in the grains. When the inter-grain tunnelling conductance $g\gg1$, the conductivity $\sigma$ in $d$ dimensions decreases logarithmically with temperature ($\sigma/\sigma_{0}\sim1-\frac{1}{2\pi gd}\ln(gE_{c}/T)$), while for $g\to0$, the conductivity shows simple activated behaviour ($\sigma \sim \exp(-E_c/T)$). We show, for bare tunnelling conductance $g \gtrsim 1$, that the parameter $\gamma \equiv g(1-2/(g\pi)\ln(gE_{c}/T))$ determines the competition between charging and tunnelling effects. At low enough temperatures in the regime $1\gtrsim \gamma \gg 1/\sqrt{\beta E_{c}}$, a charge is shared among a finite number $N=\sqrt{(E_{c}/T)/\ln(\pi/2\gamma z)}$ of grains, and we find a soft activation behaviour of the conductivity, $\sigma\sim z^{-1}\exp(-2\sqrt{(E_{c}/T)\ln(\pi/2\gamma z)})$, where $z$ is the effective coordination number of a grain.

"  In this paper, admitting a de Sitter (dS)-invariant vacuum in an indefinite inner product space, we present a Gupta-Bleuler type setting for causal and full dS-covariant quantization of free ""massless"" spin-2 field in dS spacetime. The term ""massless"" stands for the fact that the field displays gauge and conformal invariance properties. In this construction, the field is defined rigorously as an operator-valued distribution. It is covariant in the usual strong sense: $\underline{U}_g \underline{{\cal{K}}} (X) \underline{U}_g^{-1} = \underline{{\cal{K}}} (g.X)$, for any $g$ in the dS group, where $\underline{U}$ is associated with the indecomposable representations of the dS group, $SO_0(1,4)$, on the space of states. The theory, therefore, does not suffer from infrared divergences. Despite the appearance of negative norm states in the theory, the energy operator is positive in all physical states and vanishes in the vacuum. ","""Massless"" spin-2 field in de Sitter space"
"  Maximum principles and uniform anti-maximum principles are a ubiquitous topic in PDE theory that is closely tied to the Krein--Rutman theorem and kernel estimates for resolvents.   We take up a classical idea of Tak\'a\v{c} - to prove (anti-)maximum principles in an abstract operator theoretic framework - and combine it with recent ideas from the theory of eventually positive operator semigroups. This enables us to derive necessary and sufficient conditions for (anti-)maximum principles in a very general setting. Consequently, we are able to either prove or disprove (anti-)maximum principles for a large variety of concrete differential operators. As a bonus, for several operators that are already known to satisfy or to not satisfy anti-maximum principles, our theory gives a very clear and concise explanation of this behaviour.

"  A Milstein-type scheme was proposed to improve the rate of convergence of its approximation of the solution to a stochastic differential equation driven by a vector of continuous semimartingales. A necessary and sufficient condition was provided for this rate to be $1/n$ when the SDE is driven by a vector of continuous local martingales, or continuous semimartingales under an additional assumption on their finite variation part. The asymptotic behavior (weak convergence) of the normalized error processes was also studied. ",Asymptotic error for the Milstein scheme for SDEs driven by continuous   semimartingales
"  Motivated by recent experimental progress, we study the effect of mechanical deformations on the superconducting pairing symmetries in monolayer black phosphorus (MBP). Starting with phonon-mediated intervalley spin-singlet electron-electron pairing and making use of realistic band parameters obtained through first-principles calculations, we show that the application of weak mechanical strain in the plane of MBP can change the effective $s$-wave and $p$-wave symmetry of the superconducting correlations into effective $d$-wave and $f$-wave symmetries, respectively. This prediction of a change in the pairing symmetries might be experimentally confirmed through angular dependence high-resolution tunneling spectroscopy, the Meissner effect, and critical temperature experiments. The idea of manipulating the superconducting symmetry class by applying planar mechanical strain can be extended to other anisotropic materials as well, and may help in providing important information of the symmetries of the order parameter, perhaps even in some high-$T_c$ superconductors.

"  We derive the probability for rapidity gaps in a parton cascade and investigate the dual connection with hadronic final states. A good description of observations in e+e- annihilations is obtained by perturbative QCD calculations in MLLA using previously determined parameters (QCD scale \Lambda and k_T-cut-off Q_0) and applying the parton hadron duality picture. Further predictions are derived; especially, for gaps between jets at variable resolution we predict a strong variation of gap probabilities for small parameters y_{cut} -> 0 in the transition from jets to hadrons. Large gaps between partons correspond to large spatial separations of colour charges: a colour blanching mechanism by soft processes is suggested.

"  The recently introduced coder based on region-adaptive hierarchical transform (RAHT) for the compression of point clouds attributes, was shown to have a performance competitive with the state-of-the-art, while being much less complex. In the paper ""Compression of 3D Point Clouds Using a Region-Adaptive Hierarchical Transform"", top performance was achieved using arithmetic coding (AC), while adaptive run-length Golomb-Rice (RLGR) coding was presented as a lower-performance lower-complexity alternative. However, we have found that by reordering the RAHT coefficients we can largely increase the runs of zeros and significantly increase the performance of the RLGR-based RAHT coder. As a result, the new coder, using ordered coefficients, was shown to outperform all other coders, including AC-based RAHT, at an even lower computational cost. We present new results and plots that should enhance those in the work of Queiroz and Chou to include the new results for RLGR-RAHT. We risk to say, based on the results herein, that RLGR-RAHT with sorted coefficients is the new state-of-the-art in point cloud compression.

"  When the level separation of a qubit is modulated periodically across an avoided crossing, tunneling to the excited state - and consequently Landau-Zener-St\""uckelberg interference - can occur. The types of modulation studied so far correspond to a continuous change of the level separation. Here we study periodic latching modulation, in which the level separation is switched abruptly between two values and is kept constant otherwise. In this case, the conventional approach based on the asymptotic Landau-Zener (LZ) formula for transition probabilities is not applicable. We develop a novel adiabatic-impulse model for the evolution of the system and derive the resonance conditions. Additionally, we derive analytical results based on the rotating-wave approximation (RWA). The adiabatic-impulse model and the RWA results are compared with those of a full numerical simulation. These theoretical predictions are tested in an experimental setup consisting of a transmon whose flux bias is modulated with a square wave form. A rich spectrum is observed, with distinctive features correspoding to two regimes: slow-modulation and fast-modulation. These experimental results are shown to be in very good agreement with the theoretical models. Also, differences with respect to the well known case of sinusoidal modulation are discussed, both theoretically and experimentally.

"  We establish the presence of a spectral gap near the real axis for the damped wave equation on a manifold with negative curvature. This results holds under a dynamical condition expressed by the negativity of a topological pressure with respect to the geodesic flow. As an application, we show an exponential decay of the energy for all initial data sufficiently regular. This decay is governed by the imaginary part of a finite number of eigenvalues close to the real axis. ",Energy decay for the damped wave equation under a pressure condition
"  In this paper, we propose a decision-aided scheme for parallel SC-List decoding of polar codes. At the parallel SC-List decoder, each survival path is extended based on multiple information bits, therefore the number of split paths becomes very large and the sorting to find the top L paths becomes very complex. We propose a decision-aided scheme to reduce the number of split paths and thus reduce the sorting complexity. ",A Decision-Aided Parallel SC-List Decoder for Polar Codes
"  The effect of small scale forcing on large scale structures in $\beta$-plane two-dimensional (2D) turbulence is studied using long-term direct numerical simulations (DNS). We find that nonlinear effects remain strong at all times and for all scales and establish an inverse energy cascade that extends to the largest scales available in the system. The large scale flow develops strong spectral anisotropy: $k^{-5/3}$ Kolmogorov scaling holds for almost all $\phi$, $\phi=\arctan (k_y/k_x)$, except in the small vicinity of $k_x=0$, where Rhines's $k^{-5}$ scaling prevails. Due to the $k^{-5}$ scaling, the spectral evolution of $\beta$-plane turbulence becomes extremely slow which, perhaps, explains why this scaling law has never before been observed in DNS. Simulations with different values of $\beta$ indicate that the $\beta$-effect diminishes at small scales where the flow is nearly isotropic. Thus, for simulations of $\b$-plane turbulence forced at small scales sufficiently removed from the scales where $\b$-effect is strong, large eddy simulation (LES) can be used. A subgrid scale (SGS) parameterization for such LES must account for the small scale forcing that is not explicitly resolved and correctly accommodate two inviscid conservation laws, viz. energy and enstrophy. This requirement gives rise to a new anisotropic stabilized negative viscosity (SNV) SGS representation which is discussed in the context of LES of isotropic 2D turbulence.

"  A Brownian particle's random motions can be rectified by a periodic potential energy landscape that alternates between two states, even if both states are spatially symmetric. If the two states differ only by a discrete translation, the direction of the ratchet-driven current can be reversed by changing their relative durations.

"  We present the results of BV(RI)_KC CCD photometry down to V=21 mag in the region of NGC 6994. To our knowledge, no photometry has previously been reported for this object and we find evidences that it is a poor and sparse old open cluster, with a minimum angular diameter of 9 arcmin, i.e. larger than the 3 arcmin originally assigned to it. We obtain a color excess E(B-V) = 0.07 +/- 0.02 mag by means of the BVI_(C) technique. Based on the theoretical isochrones from VandenBergh (1985) that are in better agreement with our data, we estimate for this cluster a distance from the Sun of 620 pc (Vo-Mv = 9 +/- 0.25 mag) and an age lying within the range of 2 - 3 Gyr, adopting solar metallicity. Thus, the corresponding cluster's Galactocentric distance is 8.1 kpc and is placed at about 350 pc below the Galactic plane. According to this results, NGC 6994 belongs to the old open cluster population located in the outer disk and at large distances from the Galactic plane, and must have suffered significant individual dynamical evolution, resulting in mass segregation and evaporation of low mass stars.

"  High-fidelity control of qubits requires precisely tuned control parameters. Typically, these parameters are found through a series of bootstrapped calibration experiments which successively acquire more accurate information about a physical qubit. However, optimal parameters are typically different between devices and can also drift in time, which begets the need for an efficient calibration strategy. Here, we introduce a framework to understand the relationship between calibrations as a directed graph. With this approach, calibration is reduced to a graph traversal problem that is automatable and extensible. ",Physical qubit calibration on a directed acyclic graph
"  The Alpha Centauri AB system is an attractive one for radial velocity observations to detect potential exoplanets. The high metallicity of both Alpha Centauri A and B suggest that they could have possessed circumstellar discs capable of forming planets. As the closest star system to the Sun, with well over a century of accurate astrometric measurements (and Alpha Centauri B exhibiting low chromospheric activity) high precision surveys of Alpha Centauri B's potential exoplanetary system are possible with relatively cheap instrumentation. Authors studying habitability in this system typically adopt habitable zones (HZs) based on global radiative balance models that neglect the radiative perturbations of Alpha Centauri A.   We investigate the habitability of planets around Alpha Centauri B using 1D latitudinal energy balance models (LEBMs), which fully incorporate the presence of Alpha Centauri A as a means of astronomically forcing terrestrial planet climates. We find that the extent of the HZ is relatively unchanged by the presence of Alpha Centauri A, but there are variations in fractional habitability for planets orbiting at the boundaries of the zone due to Alpha Centauri A, even in the case of zero eccentricity. Temperature oscillations of a few K can be observed at all planetary orbits, the strength of which varies with the planet's ocean fraction and obliquity.

"  We implemented a low noise current preamplifier for the readout of resistive bolometers. We tested the apparatus on thermometer resistances ranging from 10 Ohm to 500 Mohm. The use of current preamplifier overcomes constraints introduced by the readout time constant due to the thermometer resistance and the input capacitance. Using cold JFETs, this preamplifier board is shown to have very low noise: the Johnson noise of the source resistor (1 fA/Hz1/2) dominated in our noise measurements. We also implemented a lock-in chain using this preamplifier. Because of fast risetime, compensation of the phase shift may be unnecessary. If implemented, no tuning is necessary when the sensor impedance changes. Transients are very short, and thus low-passing or sampling of the signal is simplified. In case of spurious noise, the modulation frequency can be chosen in a much wider frequency range, without requiring a new calibration of the apparatus.

"  Cooper pairing in two dimensions is analyzed with a set of renormalized equations to determine its binding energy for any fermion number density and all coupling assuming a generic pairwise residual interfermion interaction. \ Also considered are Cooper pairs (CPs) with nonzero center-of-mass momentum (CMM)--usually neglected in BCS theory--and their binding energy is expanded analytically in powers of the CMM up to quadratic terms. A Fermi-sea-dependent {\it linear} term in the CMM dominates the pair excitation energy in weak coupling (also called the BCS regime) while the more familiar quadratic term prevails in strong coupling (the Bose regime). The crossover, though strictly unrelated to BCS theory {\it per se,} is studied numerically as it is expected to play a central role in a model of superconductivity as a Bose-Einstein condensation of CPs where the transition temperature vanishes for all dimensionality $d\leq 2$ for quadratic dispersion, but is {\it nonzero} for all $d\geq 1$ for linear dispersion.

"  In the present article, the authors intend to propose a new theory which potentially allows the propagation of the formation and the evolution of quarkonium in a thermal BIon. When quarks are close to each other, quarkonium behaves like a scalar and by their getting away, it transits to a fermionic system. In order to analyze this particular behaviour, a new outlook approach needs to be adopted as the concurrent view is found deficient to analyse the aforesaid behaviour. Therefore, the authors' post deliberation accept the fermions and fermionic being cognate. We need to accept a theory that the origin of fermions and bosons be the same. However, in $M$-theory, these particles are independent and for this reason, \textbf{we use a new broader theory based on Lie-$N$-Algebra and we call it BLNA (Broad Lie-$N$-Algebra)} theory. Thus, the BLNA in a way the $M$-theory with $11$ dimensions. In this model, two types of energies with opposite signs emerge from nothing such as the sum over them becomes zero. They produce two types of branes with opposite quantum numbers and bosonic fields, which interact with each other and get compact. By compacting branes, the quarks and anti-quarks are produced on branes and exchange the graviton and the gravitino. These particles produce two types of wormholes which act opposite to each other. They preclude from closing or getting away of branes from each other and also occurrence of confinement. This confined potential which emerges from these wormholes depends on the separation distance between quarks and anti-quarks and also on temperature of system and is reduced to predicted potential in experiments and QCD. Also, total entropy of this system grows with increasing temperature and produces a repulsive force which leads to the separation of quarks and anti-quarks and also to the emergence of deconfinement.

A linear relation between the $CP$ asymmetries of different decay processes is obtained. ",Outcome from Spontaneous CP Violation for B Decays
"  The performance of collaborative beamforming is analyzed using the theory of random arrays. The statistical average and distribution of the beampattern of randomly generated phased arrays is derived in the framework of wireless ad hoc sensor networks. Each sensor node is assumed to have a single isotropic antenna and nodes in the cluster collaboratively transmit the signal such that the signal in the target direction is coherently added in the far- eld region. It is shown that with N sensor nodes uniformly distributed over a disk, the directivity can approach N, provided that the nodes are located sparsely enough. The distribution of the maximum sidelobe peak is also studied. With the application to ad hoc networks in mind, two scenarios, closed-loop and open-loop, are considered. Associated with these scenarios, the effects of phase jitter and location estimation errors on the average beampattern are also analyzed.

"  This paper gives a thorough critique of the foundations of quantum physics in its mainstream interpretation (i.e., treating pure states as primitives, without reference to hidden variables, and without modifications of the quantum laws). This is achieved by cleanly separating a concise version of the (universally accepted) formal core of quantum physics from the (controversial) interpretation issues. The latter are primarily related to measurement, but also to questions of existence and of the meaning of basic concepts like 'state' and 'particle'. The requirements for good foundations of quantum physics are discussed. Main results:   * Born's rule cannot be valid universally, and must be considered as a scientific law with a restricted domain of validity.   * If the state of every composite quantum system contains all information that can be known about this system, it cannot be a pure state in general.

"  Machine learning models of accelerator systems (`surrogate models') are able to provide fast, accurate predictions of accelerator physics phenomena. However, approaches to date typically do not include measured input diagnostics, such as the initial beam distributions, which are critical for accurately representing the beam evolution through the system. In addition, these inputs often vary over time, and models that can account for these changing conditions are needed. Simulations are in some cases needed to provide sufficient training data. These typically represent the designed machine before construction; however, the behavior of the installed components may be quite different due to changes over time or static differences that were not modeled. Therefore, surrogate models that can leverage both simulation and measured data successfully are needed. We introduce an approach based on convolutional neural networks that uses the drive laser distribution and scalar settings as inputs for the Linac Coherent Light Source II injector frontend. The model is able to predict scalar beam parameters and the transverse beam distribution downstream, taking into account the impact of time-varying non-uniformities in the initial transverse laser distribution. We also introduce and evaluate a transfer learning procedure for adapting the surrogate model from the simulation domain to the measurement domain, to account for differences between the two. Applying this approach to our test case results in a model that can predict test sample outputs within a mean absolute percent error of 7.6%. This is a substantial improvement over the model trained only on simulations, which has an error of 112.7% when applied to measured data. While we focus on the LCLS-II Injector frontend, these approaches for improving ML-based online modeling of injector systems could be easily adapted to other accelerator facilities.

"  A code, Epic5, has been developed which computes, in the two-dimensional case, the initially circular orbits of guiding centra in an arbitrary axisymmetric potential with an arbitrary, weak perturbing potential in solid body rotation. This perturbing potential is given by its Fourier expansion. The analytic solution solves the linear epicyclic approximation of the equations of motion. To simulate the motion of interstellar matter and to damp the Lindblad resonances, we have in these equations introduced a friction which is proportional to the deviation from circular velocity. The corotation resonance is also damped by a special parameter. The program produces, in just a few seconds, orbital and density maps, as well as line of sight velocity maps for a chosen orientation of the galaxy.   We test Epic5 by comparing its results with previous simulations and observations from the literature, which gives satisfactory agreement. The aim is that this program should be a useful complement to elaborate numerical simulations. Particularly so are its abilities to quickly explore the parameter space, to construct artificial galaxies, and to isolate various single agents important for developing structure of interstellar matter in disc galaxies.

"  Perceiving the world in terms of objects and tracking them through time is a crucial prerequisite for reasoning and scene understanding. Recently, several methods have been proposed for unsupervised learning of object-centric representations. However, since these models were evaluated on different downstream tasks, it remains unclear how they compare in terms of basic perceptual abilities such as detection, figure-ground segmentation and tracking of objects. To close this gap, we design a benchmark with four data sets of varying complexity and seven additional test sets featuring challenging tracking scenarios relevant for natural videos. Using this benchmark, we compare the perceptual abilities of four object-centric approaches: ViMON, a video-extension of MONet, based on recurrent spatial attention, OP3, which exploits clustering via spatial mixture models, as well as TBA and SCALOR, which use explicit factorization via spatial transformers. Our results suggest that the architectures with unconstrained latent representations learn more powerful representations in terms of object detection, segmentation and tracking than the spatial transformer based architectures. We also observe that none of the methods are able to gracefully handle the most challenging tracking scenarios despite their synthetic nature, suggesting that our benchmark may provide fruitful guidance towards learning more robust object-centric video representations.

"  The CFR framework has been a powerful tool for solving large-scale extensive-form games in practice. However, the theoretical rate at which past CFR-based algorithms converge to the Nash equilibrium is on the order of $O(T^{-1/2})$, where $T$ is the number of iterations. In contrast, first-order methods can be used to achieve a $O(T^{-1})$ dependence on iterations, yet these methods have been less successful in practice. In this work we present the first CFR variant that breaks the square-root dependence on iterations. By combining and extending recent advances on predictive and stable regret minimizers for the matrix-game setting we show that it is possible to leverage ""optimistic"" regret minimizers to achieve a $O(T^{-3/4})$ convergence rate within CFR. This is achieved by introducing a new notion of stable-predictivity, and by setting the stability of each counterfactual regret minimizer relative to its location in the decision tree. Experiments show that this method is faster than the original CFR algorithm, although not as fast as newer variants, in spite of their worst-case $O(T^{-1/2})$ dependence on iterations.

"  The large thermal capacity of buildings enables heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems to be exploited as demand response (DR) resources. Optimal DR of HVAC units is challenging, particularly for multi-zone buildings, because this requires detailed physics-based models of zonal temperature variations for HVAC system operation and building thermal conditions. This paper proposes a new strategy for optimal DR of an HVAC system in a multi-zone building, based on supervised learning (SL). Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are trained with data obtained under normal building operating conditions. The ANNs are replicated using piecewise linear equations, which are explicitly integrated into an optimal scheduling problem for price-based DR. The optimization problem is solved for various electricity prices and building thermal conditions. The solutions are further used to train a deep neural network (DNN) to directly determine the optimal DR schedule, referred to here as supervised-learning-aided meta-prediction (SLAMP). Case studies are performed using three different methods: explicit ANN replication (EAR), SLAMP, and physics-based modeling. The case study results verify the effectiveness of the proposed SL-based strategy, in terms of both practical applicability and computational time, while also ensuring the thermal comfort of occupants and cost-effective operation of the HVAC system.

"  When engaging in argumentative discourse, skilled human debaters tailor claims to the beliefs of the audience, to construct effective arguments. Recently, the field of computational argumentation witnessed extensive effort to address the automatic generation of arguments. However, existing approaches do not perform any audience-specific adaptation. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap by studying the task of belief-based claim generation: Given a controversial topic and a set of beliefs, generate an argumentative claim tailored to the beliefs. To tackle this task, we model the people's prior beliefs through their stances on controversial topics and extend state-of-the-art text generation models to generate claims conditioned on the beliefs. Our automatic evaluation confirms the ability of our approach to adapt claims to a set of given beliefs. In a manual study, we additionally evaluate the generated claims in terms of informativeness and their likelihood to be uttered by someone with a respective belief. Our results reveal the limitations of modeling users' beliefs based on their stances, but demonstrate the potential of encoding beliefs into argumentative texts, laying the ground for future exploration of audience reach.

"  Let $F_{n}$ and $L_n$ be the $n$th Fibonacci and Lucas number, respectively. For each positive integer $m$, the order of appearance of $m$ in the Fibonacci sequence, denoted by $z(m)$, is the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $m$ divides $F_k$. Recently, D.

"  While machine learning is traditionally a resource intensive task, embedded systems, autonomous navigation, and the vision of the Internet of Things fuel the interest in resource-efficient approaches. These approaches aim for a carefully chosen trade-off between performance and resource consumption in terms of computation and energy. The development of such approaches is among the major challenges in current machine learning research and key to ensure a smooth transition of machine learning technology from a scientific environment with virtually unlimited computing resources into every day's applications. In this article, we provide an overview of the current state of the art of machine learning techniques facilitating these real-world requirements. In particular, we focus on deep neural networks (DNNs), the predominant machine learning models of the past decade. We give a comprehensive overview of the vast literature that can be mainly split into three non-mutually exclusive categories: (i) quantized neural networks, (ii) network pruning, and (iii) structural efficiency. These techniques can be applied during training or as post-processing, and they are widely used to reduce the computational demands in terms of memory footprint, inference speed, and energy efficiency. We substantiate our discussion with experiments on well-known benchmark data sets to showcase the difficulty of finding good trade-offs between resource-efficiency and predictive performance.

"  Ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions recreate in the laboratory the thermodynamical conditions prevailing in the early universe up to 10$^{-6}$ seconds, thereby allowing the study of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), a state of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) matter with deconfined partons. The top quark, the heaviest elementary particle known, is accessible in nucleus-nucleus collisions at the CERN LHC, and constitutes a novel probe of the QGP. Here, we report the first-ever evidence for the production of top quarks in nucleus-nucleus collisions, using lead-lead collision data at a nucleon-nucleon centre-of-mass energy of 5.02 TeV recorded by the CMS experiment. Two methods are used to measure the cross section for top quark pair production ($\sigma_\mathrm{t\bar{t}}$) via the decay into charged leptons (electrons or muons) and bottom quarks. One method relies on the leptonic information alone, and the second one exploits, in addition, the presence of bottom quarks. The measured cross sections, $\sigma_\mathrm{t\bar{t}} = $ 2.54 $^{+0.84}_{-0.74}$ and 2.03 $^{+0.71}_{-0.64}$ $\mu$b, respectively, are compatible with expectations from scaled proton-proton data and QCD predictions.

"  This paper describes the characterization of crystal matrices and silicon photomultiplier arrays for a novel Positron Emission Tomography (PET) detector, namely the external plate of the EndoTOFPET-US system. The EndoTOFPET-US collaboration aims to integrate Time-Of-Flight PET with ultrasound endoscopy in a novel multimodal device, capable to support the development of new biomarkers for prostate and pancreatic tumors. The detector consists in two parts: a PET head mounted on an ultrasound probe and an external PET plate. The challenging goal of 1 mm spatial resolution for the PET image requires a detector with small crystal size, and therefore high channel density: 4096 LYSO crystals individually readout by Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPM) make up the external plate. The quality and properties of these components must be assessed before the assembly. The dark count rate, gain, breakdown voltage and correlated noise of the SiPMs are measured, while the LYSO crystals are evaluated in terms of light yield and energy resolution. In order to effectively reduce the noise in the PET image, high time resolution for the gamma detection is mandatory. The Coincidence Time Resolution (CTR) of all the SiPMs assembled with crystals is measured, and results show a value close to the demanding goal of 200 ps FWHM. The light output is evaluated for every channel for a preliminary detector calibration, showing an average of about 1800 pixels fired on the SiPM for a 511 keV interaction. Finally, the average energy resolution at 511 keV is about 13 %, enough for effective Compton rejection.

"  The measured spatiotemporal response of various physical processes is utilized to infer the governing partial differential equations (PDEs). We propose SimultaNeous Basis Function Approximation and Parameter Estimation (SNAPE), a technique of parameter estimation of PDEs that is robust against high levels of noise nearly 100 %, by simultaneously fitting basis functions to the measured response and estimating the parameters of both ordinary and partial differential equations. The domain knowledge of the general multidimensional process is used as a constraint in the formulation of the optimization framework. SNAPE not only demonstrates its applicability on various complex dynamic systems that encompass wide scientific domains including Schr\""odinger equation, chaotic duffing oscillator, and Navier-Stokes equation but also estimates an analytical approximation to the process response.

"  Electrical Capacitance Tomography (ECT) is an imaging technique providing the distribution of permittivity in a medium by the mean of electrodes. As for any imaging systems, the reachable spatial resolution is a key parameter. In this paper the spatial resolution of ECT sensors is analyzed in terms of the accuracy of an object position and of the ability to distinguish between two close objects. Cylindrical geometry sensors are particularly studied and the example of a square geometry sensor is used to show how to study any other geometries. In cylindrical geometries, it is shown that a 50% gap between electrodes is a good compromise and that increasing the number of electrodes improves the spatial resolution near the electrodes but decreases the spatial resolution in the center. The best spatial resolution at the center of the sensor is obtained with 3 or 4 electrodes. In the square geometry studied, it is shown that a better distribution of the spatial resolution is obtained when there are electrodes in the corners.

"  All current investigations to analyze the derivational complexity of term rewrite systems are based on a single termination method, possibly preceded by transformations. However, the exclusive use of direct criteria is problematic due to their restricted power. To overcome this limitation the article introduces a modular framework which allows to infer (polynomial) upper bounds on the complexity of term rewrite systems by combining different criteria. Since the fundamental idea is based on relative rewriting, we study how matrix interpretations and match-bounds can be used and extended to measure complexity for relative rewriting, respectively. The modular framework is proved strictly more powerful than the conventional setting. Furthermore, the results have been implemented and experiments show significant gains in power.

"  In this paper, the agent-based modeling is employed to model the effect of intellectual property policy at the speed of technological advancement. Every agent has inborn preferences towards investing their capital into independent technological development, innovation appropriation, and production. The relative cost of appropriation compared to independent development is chosen as a measure of strictness of intellectual property protection. We vary this parameter and look at the performance of agents with different preferences and overall technological progress. In general, it is found that in the specific setting considered with stronger intellectual property protection leads to faster progress.

"  A phase field theory of polycrystalline solidification is presented that is able to describe the nucleation and growth of anisotropic particles with different crystallographic orientation in three dimensions. As opposed with the two-dimensional case, where a single orientation field suffices, in three dimensions, minimum three fields are needed. The free energy of grain boundaries is assumed to be proportional to the angular difference between the adjacent crystals expressed here in terms of the differences of the four symmetric Euler parameters. The equations of motion for these fields are obtained from variational principles. Illustrative calculations are performed for polycrystalline solidification with dendritic, needle and spherulitic growth morphologies.

"  Given a negative $D>-(\log X)^{\log 2-\delta}$, we give a new upper bound on the number of square free integers $<X$ which are represented by some but not all forms of the genus of a primitive positive definite binary quadratic form $f$ of discriminant $D$. We also give an analogous upper bound for square free integers of the form $q+a<X$ where $q$ is prime and $a\in\mathbb Z$ is fixed. Combined with the 1/2-dimensional sieve of Iwaniec, this yields a lower bound on the number of such integers $q+a<X$ represented by a binary quadratic form of discriminant $D$, where $D$ is allowed to grow with $X$ as above. An immediate consequence of this, coming from recent work of the authors in [BF], is a lower bound on the number of primes which come up as curvatures in a given primitive integer Apollonian circle packing.

The application of this model to non-equilibrium phenomena is explored by a study of the dynamics of an atom cloud subject to a sudden displacement of the confining potential. Good agreement is found with results of recent experiments. The simplicity and intuitive appeal of this model make it attractive as a general tool for understanding bosonic systems in the strongly correlated regime.

  The masses and radii of non-rotating and rotating configurations of pure hadronic stars mixed with self-interacting fermionic Asymmetric Dark Matter are calculated within the two-fluid formalism of stellar structure equations in general relativity. The Equation of State (EoS) of nuclear matter is obtained from the density dependent M3Y effective nucleon-nucleon interaction. We consider dark matter particle mass of 1 GeV.

We explore the conditions of equal and different rotational frequencies of nuclear matter and dark matter and find that the maximum mass of differentially rotating stars with self-interacting dark matter to be $\sim 1.94 M_\odot$ with radius $\sim 10.4$ kms. ,Compact bifluid hybrid stars: Hadronic Matter mixed with   self-interacting fermionic Asymmetric Dark Matter

"  We investigate the microscopic mechanisms of the charge-density-wave (CDW) formation in a monolayer TiSe$_2$ using a realistic multiorbital $d$-$p$ model with electron-phonon coupling and intersite Coulomb (excitonic) interactions. First, we estimate the tight-binding bands of Ti $3d$ and Se $4p$ orbitals in the monolayer TiSe$_2$ on the basis of the first-principles band structure calculations. We thereby show orbital textures of the undistorted band structure near the Fermi level. Next, we derive the electron-phonon coupling using the tight-binding approximation and show that the softening occurs in the transverse phonon mode at the M point of the Brillouin zone. The stability of the triple-$q$ CDW state is thus examined to show that the transverse phonon modes at the M$_1$, M$_2$, and M$_3$ points are frozen simultaneously. Then, we introduce the intersite Coulomb interactions between the nearest-neighbor Ti and Se atoms that lead to the excitonic instability between the valence Se $4p$ and conduction Ti $3d$ bands. Treating the intersite Coulomb interactions in the mean-field approximation, we show that the electron-phonon and excitonic interactions cooperatively stabilize the triple-$q$ CDW state in TiSe$_2$. We also calculate a single-particle spectrum in the CDW state and reproduce the band folding spectra observed in photoemission spectroscopies. Finally, to clarify the nature of the CDW state, we examine the electronic charge density distribution and show that the CDW state in TiSe$_2$ is of a bond-type and induces a vortex-like antiferroelectric polarization in the kagome network of Ti atoms.

  Sensory rhodopsin II (SRII) is a seven helix protein that belongs to the rhodopsin protein family. Light induced conformational changes govern SRII's function. These changes are related to the photo cycle of the protein that is comprised of various metastable states. After the completion of this cycle the protein returns to its ground state. Mutational studies of key residues will reveal the mechanism that underlies the function of the protein.

"  Let $\frak g$ be a semisimple Lie algebra and $\frak k\subset\frak g$ be a reductive subalgebra. We say that a $\frak g$-module $M$ is a bounded $(\frak g, \frak k)$-module if $M$ is a direct sum of simple finite-dimensional $\frak k$-modules and the multiplicities of all simple $\frak k$-modules in that direct sum are universally bounded.   The goal of this article is to show that the ""boundedness"" property for a simple $(\frak g, \frak k)$-module $M$ is equivalent to a property of the associated variety of the annihilator of $M$ (this is the closure of a nilpotent coadjoint orbit inside $\frak g^*$) under the assumption that the main field is algebraically closed and of characteristic 0. In particular this implies that if $M_1, M_2$ are simple $(\frak g, \frak k)$-modules such that $M_1$ is bounded and the associated varieties of the annihilators of $M_1$ and $M_2$ coincide then $M_2$ is also bounded.

"  Collisionless shocks occur in various fields of physics. In the context of space and astrophysics they have been investigated for many decades. However, a thorough understanding of shock formation and particle acceleration is still missing. Collisionless shocks can be distinguished into electromagnetic and electrostatic shocks. Electromagnetic shocks are of importance mainly in astrophysical environments and they are mediated by the Weibel or filamentation instability. In such shocks, charged particles gain energy by diffusive shock acceleration. Electrostatic shocks are characterized by a strong electrostatic field, which leads to electron trapping.

"  Software-defined networking (SDN) paradigm, with the flexible and logically centralized control, enables dynamically minimizing the network energy consumption by redirecting paths of packets. However, the links and switches are designed to accommodate maximum traffic volume and their power consumption is not traffic proportional. Moreover, there exists a trade-off between energy efficiency and network performance that need to be considered together. Addressing these issues, we propose an energy efficiency metric named Ratio for Energy Saving in SDN (RESDN) that quantifies energy efficiency based on link utility intervals. We provide integer programming formulation and method for maximizing the RESDN of the network. To the best of our knowledge, RESDN approach is novel as it measures how links are profitably utilized in terms of the amount of energy they consume with respect to their utility. We analyze our approach considering various metrics of interest, and different types of SDN enabled switches. Experiments show that maximizing the RESDN value improves energy efficiency while maintaining acceptable network performance. In comparison to state-of-the-art utility-based heuristics, RESDN method achieves up to 30% better ratio for energy saving, 14.7 watts per switch power saving, 38% link saving, 2 hops decrease in average path length, 5% improved traffic proportionality.

"  In this paper we address a discrepancy between the surface flux evolution in a 3D kinematic dynamo model and a 2D surface flux transport model that has been closely calibrated to the real Sun. We demonstrate that the difference is due to the connectivity of active regions to the toroidal field at the base of the convection zone, which is not accounted for in the surface-only model. Initially, we consider the decay of a single active region, firstly in a simplified Cartesian 2D model and subsequently the full 3D model. By varying the turbulent diffusivity profile in the convection zone, we find that increasing the diffusivity - so that active regions are more rapidly disconnected from the base of the convection zone - improves the evolution of the surface field. However, if we simulate a full solar cycle, we find that the dynamo is unable to sustain itself under such an enhanced diffusivity. This suggests that in order to accurately model the solar cycle, we must find an alternative way to disconnect emerging active regions, whilst conserving magnetic flux.

"  This is the continuation of previous article. For subspaces $M^n(t)$ and $M^{n-m}(t)$ which are invariant manifolds of the differential equation under consideration we build a change of variables which splits this equation into a system of two independent equations. A notion of equivalence of linear differential equations of different orders is introduced. Necessary and sufficient conditions of this equivalence are given. These results are applied to the Flocke-Lyapunov theory for linear equations with periodic coefficients with a period T. In the case when monodromy matrix of the equation has negative eigenvalues, thus reduction in $R^m$ to an equation with constant coeficcients is possible only with doubling of reduction matrix period, we prove the possibility of splitting off in $R^m$ of equations with negative eigenvalues of monodromy matrix with the help of a real matrix without period doubling. For the fundamental matrix of solutions of an equation with periodic coefficients $X(t), X(t)=E$, we find representation $X(t)=\Phi(t)e^{Ht}\Phi^{+}(0)$ with real rectangular matrices $H$ and $\Phi(t), \Phi(t)=\Phi(t+T)$. We bring two applications of these results: 1) reduction of nonlinear differential equation in $R^n$ with distinguished linear part which is periodic with period T to the equation in $R^m, m>n$, with a constiant matrix of coefficients of the linear part; 2) for introdusing of amplitude-phase coordinates in the neigbourhood of periodic orbit of autonomous differential equation with separation of the linear part with constant matrix of coefficients.

"  We investigate the viability of using machine-learning techniques for estimating user-channel features at a large-array base station (BS). In the scenario we consider, user-pilot broadcasts are observed and processed by the BS to extract angle-of-arrival (AoA) specific information about propagation-channel features, such as received signal strength and relative path delay. The problem of interest involves using this information to predict the angle-of-departure (AoD) of the dominant propagation paths in the user channels, i.e., channel features not directly observable at the BS. To accomplish this task, the data collected in the same propagation environment are used to train neural networks. Our studies rely on ray-tracing channel data that have been calibrated against measurements from Shinjuku Square, a famous hotspot in Tokyo, Japan. We demonstrate that the observed features at the BS side are correlated with the angular features at the user side. We train neural networks that exploit different combinations of measured features at the BS to infer the unknown parameters at the users. The evaluation based on standard statistical performance metrics suggests that such data-driven methods have the potential to predict unobserved channel features from observed ones.

"  Despite the rise to fame of incremental variance-reduced methods in recent years, their use in nonsmooth optimization is still limited to few simple cases. This is due to the fact that existing methods require to evaluate the proximity operator for the nonsmooth terms, which can be a costly operation for complex penalties. In this work we introduce two variance-reduced incremental methods based on SAGA and SVRG that can efficiently take into account complex penalties which can be expressed as a sum of proximal terms. This includes penalties such as total variation, group lasso with overlap and trend filtering, to name a few. Furthermore, we also develop sparse variants of the proposed algorithms which can take advantage of sparsity in the input data. Like other incremental methods, it only requires to evaluate the gradient of a single sample per iteration, and so is ideally suited for large scale applications. We provide a convergence rate analysis for the proposed methods and show that they converge with a fixed step-size, achieving in some cases the same asymptotic rate as their full gradient variants. Empirical benchmarks on 3 different datasets illustrate the practical advantages of the proposed methods. ",Proximal Splitting Meets Variance Reduction
"  The Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice describes charge carriers in graphene with short range interactions.

"  Disruption management during the airline scheduling process can be compartmentalized into proactive and reactive processes depending upon the time of schedule execution. The state of the art for decision-making in airline disruption management involves a heuristic human-centric approach that does not categorically study uncertainty in proactive and reactive processes for managing airline schedule disruptions. Hence, this paper introduces an uncertainty transfer function model (UTFM) framework that characterizes uncertainty for proactive airline disruption management before schedule execution, reactive airline disruption management during schedule execution, and proactive airline disruption management after schedule execution to enable the construction of quantitative tools that can allow an intelligent agent to rationalize complex interactions and procedures for robust airline disruption management.

"  Every smooth fiber bundle admits a complete (Ehresmann) connection. This result appears in several references, with a proof on which we have found a gap, that does not seem possible to remedy. In this note we provide a definite proof for this fact, explain the problem with the previous one, and illustrate with examples.

"  Several perturbation tools are established in the volume preserving setting allowing for the pasting, extension, localized smoothing and local linearization of vector fields. The pasting and local linearization hold in all classes of regularity ranging from $C^{1}$ to $C^{\infty}$ (H\""older included). For diffeomorphisms, a conservative linearized version of Franks lemma is proved in the $C^{r,\alpha}$ ($r\in\mathbb{Z}^+$, $0<\alpha <1$) and $C^{\infty}$ settings, the resulting diffeomorphism having the same regularity as the original one.

"  We investigate for the first time the enhancement of the stimulated Raman scattering in slow-light Silicon-on-Insulator (SOI) photonic crystal line defect waveguides. By applying the Bloch-Floquet formalism to the guided modes in a planar photonic crystal, we develop a formalism that relates the intensity of the down-shifted Stokes signal to the pump intensity and the modal group velocities. The formalism is then applied to two prospective schemes for enhanced stimulated Raman generation in slow-light photonic crystal waveguides. The results demonstrate a maximum factor of 10^4 (66,000) enhancement with respect to SOI channel waveguides. Effects of two photon absorption, intrinsic scattering, and disorder with respect to slow-light Raman generation towards optically-pumped silicon amplifiers and lasers are also discussed.

"  We present a Temporal Context Network (TCN) for precise temporal localization of human activities. Similar to the Faster-RCNN architecture, proposals are placed at equal intervals in a video which span multiple temporal scales. We propose a novel representation for ranking these proposals. Since pooling features only inside a segment is not sufficient to predict activity boundaries, we construct a representation which explicitly captures context around a proposal for ranking it. For each temporal segment inside a proposal, features are uniformly sampled at a pair of scales and are input to a temporal convolutional neural network for classification. After ranking proposals, non-maximum suppression is applied and classification is performed to obtain final detections. TCN outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the ActivityNet dataset and the THUMOS14 dataset. ",Temporal Context Network for Activity Localization in Videos
"  Dilepton emission rates from a hadronic gas at finite temperature and baryon density are completely constrained by broken chiral symmetry in a density expansion. The rates can be expressed in terms of vacuum correlations which are measured in $e^+e^-$ annihilation, $\tau$ decays and photo-reactions on nucleons and nuclei. In this paper, the theoretical results are summarized and the total dimuon yield is calculated by integrating the dimuon rates over the space-time history of a fireball based on hydrodynamic calculations with CERN SPS conditions.

"  Resources are rarely distributed uniformly within a population. Heterogeneity in the concentration of a drug, the quality of breeding sites, or wealth can all affect evolutionary dynamics. In this study, we represent a collection of properties affecting the fitness at a given location using a color. A green node is rich in resources while a red node is poorer. More colors can represent a broader spectrum of resource qualities. For a population evolving according to the birth-death Moran model, the first question we address is which structures, identified by graph connectivity and graph coloring, are evolutionarily equivalent. We prove that all properly two-colored, undirected, regular graphs are evolutionarily equivalent (where ""properly colored"" means that no two neighbors have the same color). We then compare the effects of background heterogeneity on properly two-colored graphs to those with alternative schemes in which the colors are permuted. Finally, we discuss dynamic coloring as a model for spatiotemporal resource fluctuations, and we illustrate that random dynamic colorings often diminish the effects of background heterogeneity relative to a proper two-coloring.

"  Cloud computing as a potential paradigm offers tremendous advantages to enterprises. With the cloud computing, the market's entrance time is reduced, computing capabilities is augmented and computing power is really limitless. Usually, to use the full power of cloud computing, cloud users has to rely on external cloud service provider for managing their data. Nevertheless, the management of data and services are probably not fully trustworthy. Hence, data owners are uncomfortable to place their sensitive data outside their own system .i.e., in the cloud. Bringing transparency, trustworthiness and security in the cloud model, in order to fulfill client's requirements are still ongoing. To achieve this goal, our paper introduces two levels security framework: Cloud Service Provider (CSP) and Cloud Service User (CSU). Each level is responsible for a particular task of the security. The CSU level includes a proxy agent and a trust agent, dealing with the first verification. Then a second verification is performed at the CSP level. The framework incorporates a trust model to monitor users' behaviors. The use of mobile agents will exploit their intrinsic features such as mobility, deliberate localization and secure communication channel provision. This model aims to protect user's sensitive information from other internal or external users and hackers. Moreover, it can detect policy breaches, where the users are notified in order to take necessary actions when malicious access or malicious activity would occur.

"  In this paper, we develop new first-order method for composite non-convex minimization problems with simple constraints and inexact oracle. The objective function is given as a sum of ""`hard""', possibly non-convex part, and ""`simple""' convex part. Informally speaking, oracle inexactness means that, for the ""`hard""' part, at any point we can approximately calculate the value of the function and construct a quadratic function, which approximately bounds this function from above. We give several examples of such inexactness: smooth non-convex functions with inexact H\""older-continuous gradient, functions given by auxiliary uniformly concave maximization problem, which can be solved only approximately. For the introduced class of problems, we propose a gradient-type method, which allows to use different proximal setup to adapt to geometry of the feasible set, adaptively chooses controlled oracle error, allows for inexact proximal mapping. We provide convergence rate for our method in terms of the norm of generalized gradient mapping and show that, in the case of inexact H\""older-continuous gradient, our method is universal with respect to H\""older parameters of the problem. Finally, in a particular case, we show that small value of the norm of generalized gradient mapping at a point means that a necessary condition of local minimum approximately holds at that point.

"  We report the detection of giant pulse emission from PSR~B0950+08 in 12 hours of observations made simultaneously at 42~MHz and 74~MHz, using the first station of the Long Wavelength Array, LWA1. We detected 275 giant pulses (in 0.16\% of the pulse periods) and 465 giant pulses (0.27\%) at 42 and 74~MHz, respectively. The pulsar is weaker and produces less frequent giant pulses than at 100~MHz. Here, giant pulses are taken as having $\geq$ 10 times the flux density of an average pulse; their cumulative distribution of pulse strength follows a power law, with a index of $-$4.1 at 42~MHz and $-$5.1 at 74~MHz, which is much less steep than would be expected if we were observing the tail of a Gaussian distribution of normal pulses. We detected no other transient pulses in a wide dispersion measure range from 1 to 5000~pc~cm$^{-3}$. There were 128 giant pulses detected within in the same periods from both 42 and 74~MHz, which means more than half of them are not generated in a wide band. We use CLEAN-based algorithm to analyze the temporal broadening and conclude that the scattering effect from the interstellar medium can not be observed. We calculated the altitude $r$ of the emission region using the dipolar magnetic field model. We found $r$(42~MHz) = 29.27~km ($0.242\%$ of $R_{LC}$) and $r$(74~MHz) = 29.01~km ($0.240\%$ of $R_{LC}$) for the average pulse, while for giant pulses, $r$(42~MHz) = 29.10~km ($0.241\%$ of $R_{LC}$) and $r$(74~MHz) = 28.95~km ($0.240\%$ of $R_{LC}$).

"  We present the first exact analysis of some of the temporal properties of multivariate self-excited Hawkes conditional Poisson processes, which constitute powerful representations of a large variety of systems with bursty events, for which past activity triggers future activity. The term ""multivariate"" refers to the property that events come in different types, with possibly different intra- and inter-triggering abilities. We develop the general formalism of the multivariate generating moment function for the cumulative number of first-generation and of all generation events triggered by a given mother event (the ""shock"") as a function of the current time $t$. This corresponds to studying the response function of the process. A variety of different systems have been analyzed. In particular, for systems in which triggering between events of different types proceeds through a one-dimension directed or symmetric chain of influence in type space, we report a novel hierarchy of intermediate asymptotic power law decays $\sim 1/t^{1-(m+1)\theta}$ of the rate of triggered events as a function of the distance $m$ of the events to the initial shock in the type space, where $0 < \theta <1$ for the relevant long-memory processes characterizing many natural and social systems. The richness of the generated time dynamics comes from the cascades of intermediate events of possibly different kinds, unfolding via a kind of inter-breeding genealogy.

"  We present spectroscopy of three planetary nebulae (PNe) in the Northern Spur of the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) obtained with the Double Spectrograph on the 5.1 m Hale Telescope at the Palomar Observatory. The samples are selected from the observations of Merrett et al. Our purpose is to investigate formation of the substructures of M31 using PNe as a tracer of chemical abundances. The [O III] 4363 auroral line is detected in the spectra of two objects, enabling temperature determinations. Ionic abundances are derived from the observed collisionally excited lines, and elemental abundances of nitrogen, oxygen, and neon as well as sulphur and argon are estimated. Correlations between oxygen and the alpha-element abundance ratios are studied, using our sample and the M31 disk and bulge PNe from the literature. In one of the three PNe, we observed relatively higher oxygen abundance compared to the disk sample in M31 at similar galactocentric distances. The results of at least one of the three Northern Spur PNe might be in line with the proposed possible origin of the Northern Spur substructure of M31, i.e. the Northern Spur is connected to the Southern Stream and both substructures comprise the tidal debris of the satellite galaxies of M31.

"  Using renewal times and Girsanov's transform, we prove that the speed of the excited random walk is infinitely differentiable with respect to the bias parameter in $(0,1)$ for the dimension $d\ge 2$. At the critical point $0$, using a special method, we also prove that the speed is differentiable and the derivative is positive for every dimension $2\leq d\neq 3.$ However, this is not enough to imply that the speed is increasing in a neighborhood of $0.$ It still remains to prove the derivative is continuous at $0$.   Moreover, this paper gives some results of monotonicity for $m-$excited random walk when $m$ is large enough or $m=+\infty.$ ",Some results on regularity and monotonicity of the speed for excited   random walk in low dimensions
"  The basic physical parameters of a poorly studied open cluster NGC 110 and an unstudied open cluster DOLIDZE 14 are estimated in the present study using the archival PPMXL and WISE catalogues. The radius of both the clusters are estimated by fitting the modified King's empirical model on their stellar density profiles. The other basic parameters of the clusters such as distance, reddening, and age are obtained by visual fitting of the Marigo's solar metallicity isochrone on their IR colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs). The mean-proper motion of the clusters are estimated through the individual proper motion of probable members identified through the dynamical and statistical methods. The archival catalogues (JHKW1W2) are constructed for both the clusters by compiling the extracted data from the PPMXL and WISE catalogues. The various colour-excesses, such as E(J-H), E(H-K) and E(W1-W2), are estimated using the best fit theoretical isochrone on the (J-H)-H, (H-K)-H and (W1-W2)-H CMDs, respectively. The ratios of various infrared colours of the clusters are obtained through their two-colour diagrams. We also identify the most probable members in these clusters by estimating spatial, kinematic and spatio-kinematic probabilities of stars within the cluster. A correlation between the E(H-K) and E(W1-W2) is also established. ",Basic Parameters of Open Star Clusters DOLIDZE 14 and NGC 110 in   Infrared bands

"  Recent work has shown that using unlabeled data in semi-supervised learning is not always beneficial and can even hurt generalization, especially when there is a class mismatch between the unlabeled and labeled examples. We investigate this phenomenon for image classification on the CIFAR-10 and the ImageNet datasets, and with many other forms of domain shifts applied (e.g. salt-and-pepper noise). Our main contribution is Split Batch Normalization (Split-BN), a technique to improve SSL when the additional unlabeled data comes from a shifted distribution. We achieve it by using separate batch normalization statistics for unlabeled examples. Due to its simplicity, we recommend it as a standard practice. Finally, we analyse how domain shift affects the SSL training process. In particular, we find that during training the statistics of hidden activations in late layers become markedly different between the unlabeled and the labeled examples.

"  Experimental studies of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at nitrogen doped graphene electrodes have reported a remarkably low overpotential, on the order of 0.5 V, similar to Pt based electrodes. Theoretical calculations using density functional theory have lent support for this claim. However, other measurements have indicated that transition metal impurities are actually responsible for the ORR activity, thereby raising questions about the reliability of both the experiments and the calculations. In order to assess the accuracy of the theoretical calculations, various generalized gradient approximation (GGA), meta-GGA and hybrid functionals are employed here and calibrated against high-level wave function based coupled cluster calculations (CCSD(T)) of the overpotential as well as self-interaction corrected density functional calculations and published quantum Monte Carlo calculations of O adatom binding to graphene. The PBE0 and HSE06 hybrid functionals are found to give more accurate results than the GGA and meta-GGA functionals, as would be expected, and for low dopant concentration, 3.1%, the overpotential is calculated to be 1.0 V. The GGA and meta-GGA functionals give a lower estimate by as much as 0.4 V. When the dopant concentration is doubled, the overpotential calculated with hybrid functionals drops, while it increases in GGA functional calculations. The opposite trends result from different potential determining steps, the *OOH species being of central importance in the hybrid functional calculations while the reduction of *O determines the overpotential obtained in GGA and meta-GGA calculations. The results presented here are mainly based on calculations of periodic representations of the system, but a comparison is also made with molecular flake models which are found to give erratic results.

"  We introduce a novel and concise methodology to detect the parity of atomic and molecular orbitals based on photoelectron holography, which is more general than the existing schemes. It fully accounts for the Coulomb distortions of electron trajectories, does not require sculpted fields to retrieve phase information and, in principle, is applicable to a broad range of electron momenta. By comparatively measuring the differential photoelectron spectra from strong-field ionization of N$_{2}$ molecules and their companion atoms of Ar, some photoelectron holography patterns are found to be dephased for both targets. This is well reproduced by the full-dimensional time-dependent Schr\""{o}dinger equation and the Coulomb quantum-orbit strong-field approximation (CQSFA) simulation. Using the CQSFA, we trace back our observations to different parities of the 3$p$ orbital of Ar and the highest-occupied molecular orbital of N$_{2}$ via interfering Coulomb-distorted quantum orbits carrying different initial phases. This method could in principle be used to extract bound-state phases from any holographic structure, with a wide range of potential applications in recollision physics and spectroscopy.

"  Environment perception is a crucial ability for robot's interaction into an environment. One of the first steps in this direction is the combined problem of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). A new method, called G-SLAM, is proposed, where the map is considered as a set of scattered points in the continuous space followed by a probability that states the existence of an obstacle in the subsequent point in space. A probabilistic approach with particle filters for the robot's pose estimation and an adaptive recursive algorithm for the map's probability distribution estimation is presented. Key feature of the G-SLAM method is the adaptive repositioning of the scattered points and their convergence around obstacles. In this paper the goal is to estimate the best robot trajectory along with the probability distribution of the obstacles in space. For experimental purposes a four wheel rear drive car kinematic model is used and results derived from real case scenarios are discussed. ",Generative Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (G-SLAM)
"  We present a high spatial resolution study, on scales of $\sim$100pc, of the relationship between star-formation rate (SFR) and gas content within Local Group galaxy M33. Combining deep SCUBA-2 observations with archival GALEX, SDSS, WISE, Spitzer and submillimetre Herschel data, we are able to model the entire SED from UV to sub-mm wavelengths. We calculate the SFR on a pixel-by-pixel basis using the total infrared luminosity, and find a total SFR of $0.17 \pm 0.06\,\rm{M}_\odot$/yr, somewhat lower than our other two measures of SFR -- combined FUV and 24$\mu$m SFR ($0.25^{+0.10}_{-0.07}\,\rm{M}_\odot$/yr) and SED-fitting tool MAGPHYS ($0.33^{+0.05}_{-0.06}\,\rm{M}_\odot$/yr). We trace the total gas using a combination of the 21cm HI line for atomic hydrogen, and CO($\textit{J}$=2-1) data for molecular hydrogen. We have also traced the total gas using dust masses. We study the star-formation law in terms of molecular gas, total gas, and gas from dust. We perform an analysis of the star-formation law on a variety of pixel scales, from 25$^{\prime\prime}$ to 500$^{\prime\prime}$ (100pc to 2kpc). At kpc scales, we find that a linear Schmidt-type power law index is suitable for molecular gas, but the index appears to be much higher with total gas, and gas from dust. Whilst we find a strong scale dependence on the Schmidt index, the gas depletion timescale is invariant with pixel scale. ","The star-formation law at GMC scales in M33, the Triangulum Galaxy"
"  Two-dimensional second-order topological superconductors (SOTSCs) have gapped bulk and edge states, with zero-energy Majorana bound states localized at corners. Motivated by recent advances in Majorana nanowire experiments, we propose to realize a tunable SOTSC as a two-dimensional nanowire array. We show that the coupling between the Majorana modes of adjacent wires can be controlled by phase-biasing the device, allowing to access a variety of topological phases. We characterize the system using scattering theory, which provides access to its transport properties and its topological invariants. The setup is robust against disorder, both in the nanowires themselves and in the Josephson junctions formed between adjacent wires. Further, we identify a parameter regime in which an initially trivial system is rendered topological upon adding disorder, providing an example of a second-order topological Anderson phase.

"  Sequence-to-sequence (s2s) models are the basis for extensive work in natural language processing. However, some applications, such as multi-document summarization, multi-modal machine translation, and the automatic post-editing of machine translation, require mapping a set of multiple distinct inputs into a single output sequence. Recent work has introduced bespoke architectures for these multi-input settings, and developed models which can handle increasingly longer inputs; however, the performance of special model architectures is limited by the available in-domain training data. In this work we propose a simple decoding methodology which ensembles the output of multiple instances of the same model on different inputs. Our proposed approach allows models trained for vanilla s2s tasks to be directly used in multi-input settings. This works particularly well when each of the inputs has significant overlap with the others, as when compressing a cluster of news articles about the same event into a single coherent summary, and we obtain state-of-the-art results on several multi-document summarization datasets.

"  An extended volume of fluid method is developed for two-phase direct numerical simulations of systems with one viscoelastic and one Newtonian phase. A complete set of governing equations is derived by conditional volume-averaging of the local instantaneous bulk equations and interface jump conditions. The homogeneous mixture model is applied for the closure of the volume-averaged equations. An additional interfacial stress term arises in this volume-averaged formulation which requires special treatment in the finite-volume discretization on a general unstructured mesh. A novel numerical scheme is proposed for the second-order accurate finite-volume discretization of the interface stress term. We demonstrate that this scheme allows for a consistent treatment of the interface stress and the surface tension force in the pressure equation of the segregated solution approach. Because of the high Weissenberg number problem, an appropriate stabilization approach is applied to the constitutive equation of the viscoelastic phase to increase the robustness of the method at higher fluid elasticity. Direct numerical simulations of the transient motion of a bubble rising in a quiescent viscoelastic fluid are performed for the purpose of experimental code validation. The well-known jump discontinuity in the terminal bubble rise velocity when the bubble volume exceeds a critical value is captured by the method. The formulation of the interfacial stress together with the novel scheme for its discretization is found crucial for the quantitatively correct prediction of the jump discontinuity in the terminal bubble rise velocity.

To meet the demand for computing the normal forms of the Hopf bifurcations of such systems, we develop an effective new algorithm where the memory delay is treated as the perturbation parameter. To illustrate the effectiveness of the algorithm, we consider a diffusive predator-prey system with memory-based diffusion and Holling type-II functional response. By employing this newly developed procedure, we investigate the direction and stability of the delay-induced mode-1 and mode-2 Hopf bifurcations. Numerical simulations confirm our theoretical findings, that is the existence of stable spatially inhomogeneous periodic solutions with mode-1 and mode-2 spatial patterns, and the transition from the unstable mode-2 spatially inhomogeneous periodic solution to the stable mode-1 spatially inhomogeneous periodic solution.

"  Using a simple Gaussian-like Ansatz for the phase distribution of a theory with a complex action, we show how the thimble integration for the average phase factor can be plagued by a strong residual sign problem when the phase of the complex integration measure conspires with the constant phase of the integrand along the thimble. This strong sign problem prohibits the accurate computation of the average phase factor when it becomes exponentially small, and causes a strong sensitivity to the parameters describing the phase distribution.

"  The size-dependent structure of CdSe nanoparticles, with diameters ranging from 2 to 4 nm, has been studied using the atomic pair distribution function (PDF) method. The core structure of the measured CdSe nanoparticles can be described in terms of the wurtzite atomic structure with extensive stacking faults. The density of faults in the nanoparticles ~50% . The diameter of the core region was extracted directly from the PDF data and is in good agreement with the diameter obtained from standard characterization methods suggesting that there is little surface amorphous region. A compressive strain was measured in the Cd-Se bond length that increases with decreasing particle size being 0.5% with respect to bulk CdSe for the 2 nm diameter particles.

"  Context: Some secondary effects are known to introduce variations in spectra of massive binaries. These phenomena (such as the Struve--Sahade effect, difficulties to determine properly the spectral type,...) have been reported and documented in the literature. Aims: We simulate the spectra of circular massive binaries at different phases of the orbital cycle and accounting for the gravitational influence of the companion star on the shape and physical properties of the stellar surface. Methods: We use the Roche potential to compute the stellar surface, von Zeipel theorem and reflection effects to compute the surface temperature. We then interpolate in a grid of NLTE plan-parallel atmosphere model spectra to obtain the local spectrum at each surface point. We finally sum all the contributions (accounting for the Doppler shift, limb-darkening, ...) to obtain the total spectrum. The computation is done for different orbital phases and for different sets of physical and orbital parameters. Results: Our first models reproduce the Struve--Sahade effect for several lines. Another effect, surface temperature distribution is visible but the distribution predicted by our current model is not yet consistent with observations. Conclusions: In some cases, the Struve--Sahade effect as well as more complex line intensity variations could be linked to blends of intrinsically asymmetric line profiles that are not appropriatly treated by the deblending routine. Systematic variations of lines for (nearly) contact systems are also predicted by the model.

"  With the continued scaling of microelectronic devices along with the growing demand of high-speed wireless telecommunications technologies, there is increasing need for high-frequency device modeling techniques that accurately capture the quantum mechanical nature of charge transport in nanoscale devices along with the dynamic fields that are generated. In an effort to fill this gap, we develop a simulation methodology that self-consistently couples AC non-equilibrium Green functions (NEGF) with the full solution of Maxwell's equations in the frequency domain. We apply this technique to simulate radiation from a quantum-confined, quarter-wave, monopole antenna where the length $L$ is equal to one quarter of the wavelength, $\lambda_0$. Classically, such an antenna would have a narrower, more directed radiation pattern compared to one with $L \ll \lambda_0$, but we find that a quantum quarter-wave antenna has no directivity gain compared to the classical solution. We observe that the quantized wave function within the antenna significantly alter the charge and current density distribution along the length of the wire, which in turn modifies the far-field radiation pattern from the antenna. These results show that high-frequency radiation from quantum systems can be markedly different from classical expectations.

In the case of non-convex optimization problems, various different stochastic algorithms like simulated annealing, evolutionary algorithms, and tabu search are available. Most of these algorithms require user-defined parameters specific to the problem in order to find out the optimal solution. Moreover, in many situations, iterative fine-tunings are required for the user-defined parameters, and therefore these algorithms cannot adapt if the search space and the optima changes over time. In this paper we propose an \underline{a}daptive parameter-free \underline{s}tochastic \underline{o}ptimization technique for \underline{c}ontinuous random variables called ASOC.

"  The analysis of the causality is important in many fields of research. I propose a causal theory to obtain the causal effects in a causal loglinear model. It calculates them using the odds ratio and Pearl's causal theory. The effects are calculated distinguishing between a simple mediation model (model without the multiplicative interaction effect) and a mediation model with the multiplicative interaction effect. In both models it is possible also to analyze the cell effect, which is a new interaction effect. Then in a causal loglinear model there are three interaction effects: multiplicative interaction effect, additive interaction effect and cell effect ",The Causal Effects for a Causal Loglinear Model
"  We costruct the relativistic operator of the quadrupole moment of two-particle composite spin one systems with zero orbital moment of the relative motion and derive explicit analytical expression for the quadrupole moment using the approach to relativistic composite systems based on our version of the instant-form relativistic quantum mechanics (RQM). We calculate the quadrupole moments of the rho meson and of the S-wave deuteron without any free parameters, using our unified pi&rho model (Phys.

"  America has a massive railway system. As of 2006, U.S. freight railroads have 140,490 route- miles of standard gauge, but maintaining such a huge system and eliminating any dangers, like reduced track stability and poor drainage, caused by railway ballast degradation require huge amount of labor. The traditional way to quantify the degradation of ballast is to use an index called Fouling Index (FI) through ballast sampling and sieve analysis. However, determining the FI values in lab is very time-consuming and laborious, but with the help of recent development in the field of computer vision, a novel method for a potential machine-vison based ballast inspection system can be employed that can hopefully replace the traditional mechanical method. The new machine-vision approach analyses the images of the in-service ballasts, and then utilizes image segmentation algorithm to get ballast segments. By comparing the segment results and their corresponding FI values, this novel method produces a machine-vision-based index that has the best-fit relation with FI. The implementation details of how this algorithm works are discussed in this report. ",Matlab Implementation of Machine Vision Algorithm on Ballast Degradation   Evaluation
"  Local magnetic relaxation measurements in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-x}$ crystals show evidence for plastic vortex-creep associated with the motion of dislocations in the vortex lattice. This creep mechanism governs the vortex dynamics in a wide range of temperatures and fields below the melting line and above the field corresponding to the peak in the ''fishtail'' magnetization. In this range the activation energy $U_{pl}$, which decreases with field, drops below the elastic (collective) creep activation energy, $U_{el}$, which increases with field. A crossover in flux dynamics from elastic to plastic creep is shown to be the origin of the fishtail in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-x}$. ",Plastic vortex-creep in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-x}$ crystals
"  Hard components of $p_t$ spectra can be identified with minimum-bias parton fragmentation in nuclear collisions. Minimum-bias fragment distributions (FDs) can be calculated by folding a power-law parton energy spectrum with parametrized fragmentation functions (FFs) derived from $e^+$-$e^-$ and p-\=p collisions. Alterations to FFs due to parton ""energy loss"" or ""medium modification"" in Au-Au collisions are modeled by adjusting FF parametrizations consistent with rescaling QCD splitting functions. The parton spectrum is constrained by comparison with a p-p $p_t$ spectrum hard component. The reference for all nuclear collisions is the FD derived from in-vacuum $e^+$-$e^-$ FFs. Relative to that reference the hard component for p-p and peripheral Au-Au collisions is found to be {\em strongly suppressed} for smaller fragment momenta. At a specific point on centrality the Au-Au hard component transitions to enhancement at smaller momenta and suppression at larger momenta, consistent with FDs derived from medium-modified $e^+$-$e^-$ FFs.

"  Starting from Boltzmann equation with relaxation time approximation for the collision term and using Chapman-Enskog like expansion for distribution function close to equilibrium, we derive hydrodynamic evolution equations for the dissipative quantities directly from their definition. Although the form of the equations is identical to those obtained in traditional Israel-Stewart approaches employing Grad's 14-moment approximation and second moment of Boltzmann equation, the coefficients obtained are different. In the case of one-dimensional scaling expansion, we demonstrate that our results are in better agreement with numerical solution of Boltzmann equation as compared to Israel-Stewart results. We also show that including approximate higher-order corrections in viscous evolution significantly improves this agreement, thus justifying the relaxation time approximation for the collision term.

"  The detection and elimination of covert channels are performed by a network node, known as a warden. Especially if faced with adaptive covert communication parties, a regular warden equipped with a static set of normalization rules is ineffective compared to a dynamic warden. However, dynamic wardens rely on periodically changing rule sets and have their own limitations, since they do not consider traffic specifics. We propose a novel adaptive warden strategy, capable of selecting active normalization rules by taking into account the characteristics of the observed network traffic. Our goal is to disturb the covert channel and provoke the covert peers to expose themselves more by increasing the number of packets required to perform a successful covert data transfer. Our evaluation revealed that the adaptive warden has better efficiency and effectiveness when compared to the dynamic warden because of its adaptive selection of normalization rules.

"  Recently, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have emerged as a popular alternative for modeling complex high dimensional distributions. Most of the existing works implicitly assume that the clean samples from the target distribution are easily available. However, in many applications, this assumption is violated. In this paper, we consider the observation setting when the samples from target distribution are given by the superposition of two structured components and leverage GANs for learning the structure of the components. We propose two novel frameworks: denoising-GAN and demixing-GAN. The denoising-GAN assumes access to clean samples from the second component and try to learn the other distribution, whereas demixing-GAN learns the distribution of the components at the same time. Through extensive numerical experiments, we demonstrate that proposed frameworks can generate clean samples from unknown distributions, and provide competitive performance in tasks such as denoising, demixing, and compressive sensing.

"  Many open questions in X-ray astronomy are limited by the relatively small number of objects in uniform optically-identified samples, especially when rare subclasses are considered, or subsets isolated to search for evolution or correlations between wavebands. We describe initial results of a program aimed to ultimately yield 10^4 X-ray source identifications--a sample about an order of magnitude larger than earlier efforts. The technique employs X-ray data from the ROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS), and optical imaging and spectroscopic followup from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Optical objects in the SDSS catalogs are automatically cross-correlated with RASS X-ray source positions; then priorities for follow-on SDSS optical spectra of candidate counterparts are automatically assigned using an algorithm based on the known fx/fopt ratios for various classes of X-ray emitters. SDSS parameters for optical morphology, magnitude, colors, plus FIRST radio data, serve as proxies for object class.   Initial application of this approach to 1400 deg^2 of sky provides a catalog of 1200 spectroscopically confirmed quasars/AGN that are probable RASS identifications. Most of the IDs are new, and only a few percent of the AGN are likely to be random superpositions. The magnitude and redshift ranges of the counterparts extend over 15<m<21 and 0.03<z<3.6. Although most IDs are quasars and Sy 1s, a variety of other AGN subclasses are also sampled. Substantial numbers of rare AGN are found, including more than 130 narrow-line Seyfert 1s and 45 BL Lac candidates. These results already provide a sizeable set of new IDs, show utility of the sample in multi-waveband studies, and demonstrate the capability of the RASS/SDSS approach to efficiently proceed towards the largest homogeneously selected/observed sample of X-ray emitting AGN.

"  We investigate condensation phase transitions of symmetric conserved-mass aggregation (SCA) model on random networks (RNs) and scale-free networks (SFNs) with degree distribution $P(k) \sim k^{-\gamma}$. In SCA model, masses diffuse with unite rate, and unit mass chips off from mass with rate $\omega$. The dynamics conserves total mass density $\rho$. In the steady state, on RNs and SFNs with $\gamma>3$ for $\omega \neq \infty$, we numerically show that SCA model undergoes the same type condensation transitions as those on regular lattices. However the critical line $\rho_c (\omega)$ depends on network structures. On SFNs with $\gamma \leq 3$, the fluid phase of exponential mass distribution completely disappears and no phase transitions occurs. Instead, the condensation with exponentially decaying background mass distribution always takes place for any non-zero density. For the existence of the condensed phase for $\gamma \leq 3$ at the zero density limit, we investigate one lamb-lion problem on RNs and SFNs. We numerically show that a lamb survives indefinitely with finite survival probability on RNs and SFNs with $\gamma >3$, and dies out exponentially on SFNs with $\gamma \leq 3$. The finite life time of a lamb on SFNs with $\gamma \leq 3$ ensures the existence of the condensation at the zero density limit on SFNs with $\gamma \leq 3$ at which direct numerical simulations are practically impossible. At $\omega = \infty$, we numerically confirm that complete condensation takes place for any $\rho > 0$ on RNs. Together with the recent study on SFNs, the complete condensation always occurs on both RNs and SFNs in zero range process with constant hopping rate.

"  The counting of the dimension of the space of $U(N) \times U(N) \times U(N)$ polynomial invariants of a complex $3$-index tensor as a function of degree $n$ is known in terms of a sum of squares of Kronecker coefficients. For $n \le N$, the formula can be expressed in terms of a sum of symmetry factors of partitions of $n$ denoted $Z_3(n)$. We derive the large $n$ all-orders asymptotic formula for $ Z_3(n)$ making contact with high order results previously obtained numerically. The derivation relies on the dominance in the sum, of partitions with many parts of length $1$. The dominance of other small parts in restricted partition sums leads to related asymptotic results. The result for the $3$-index tensor observables gives the large $n$ asymptotic expansion for the counting of bipartite ribbon graphs with $n$ edges, and for the dimension of the associated Kronecker permutation centralizer algebra. We explain how the different terms in the asymptotics are associated with probability distributions over ribbon graphs. The large $n$ dominance of small parts also leads to conjectured formulae for the asymptotics of invariants for general $d$-index tensors. The coefficients of $ 1/n$ in these expansions involve Stirling numbers of the second kind along with restricted partition sums.

"  R144 is a recently confirmed very massive, spectroscopic binary which appears isolated from the core of the massive young star cluster R136. The dynamical ejection hypothesis as an origin for its location is claimed improbable by Sana et al. due to its binary nature and high mass. We demonstrate here by means of direct N-body calculations that a very massive binary system can be readily dynamically ejected from a R136-like cluster, through a close encounter with a very massive system. One out of four N-body cluster models produces a dynamically ejected very massive binary system with a mass comparable to R144. The system has a system mass of $\approx$ 355 Msun and is located at 36.8 pc from the centre of its parent cluster, moving away from the cluster with a velocity of 57 km/s at 2 Myr as a result of a binary-binary interaction. This implies that R144 could have been ejected from R136 through a strong encounter with an other massive binary or single star. In addition, we discuss all massive binaries and single stars which are ejected dynamically from their parent cluster in the N-body models.

"  Since the first discovery of microlensing events nearly two decades ago, gravitational microlensing has accumulated tens of TBytes of data and developed into a powerful astrophysical technique with diverse applications. The review starts with a theoretical overview of the field and then proceeds to discuss the scientific highlights. (1) Microlensing observations toward the Magellanic Clouds rule out the Milky Way halo being dominated by MAssive Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs). This confirms most dark matter is non-baryonic, consistent with other observations. (2) Microlensing has discovered about 20 extrasolar planets (16 published), including the first two Jupiter-Saturn like systems and the only ""cold Neptunes"" yet detected. They probe a different part of the parameter space and will likely provide the most stringent test of core accretion theory of planet formation. (3) Microlensing provides a unique way to measure the mass of isolated stars, including brown dwarfs to normal stars. Half a dozen or so stellar mass black hole candidates have also been proposed. (4) High-resolution, target-of-opportunity spectra of highly-magnified dwarf stars provide intriguing ""age"" determinations which may either hint at enhanced helium enrichment or unusual bulge formation theories. (5) Microlensing also measured limb-darkening profiles for close to ten giant stars, which challenges stellar atmosphere models. (6) Data from surveys also provide strong constraints on the geometry and kinematics of the Milky Way bar (through proper motions); the latter indicates predictions from current models appear to be too anisotropic compared with observations. The future of microlensing is bright given the new capabilities of current surveys and forthcoming new telescope networks from the ground and from space.

"  Cells are strongly out-of-equilibrium systems driven by continuous energy supply. They carry out many vital functions requiring active transport of various ingredients and organelles, some being small, others being large. The cytoskeleton, composed of three types of filaments, determines the shape of the cell and plays a role in cell motion. It also serves as a road network for the so-called cytoskeletal motors. These molecules can attach to a cytoskeletal filament, perform directed motion, possibly carrying along some cargo, and then detach. It is a central issue to understand how intracellular transport driven by molecular motors is regulated, in particular because its breakdown is one of the signatures of some neuronal diseases like the Alzheimer.   We give a survey of the current knowledge on microtubule based intracellular transport. We first review some biological facts obtained from experiments, and present some modeling attempts based on cellular automata. We start with background knowledge on the original and variants of the TASEP (Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process), before turning to more application oriented models. After addressing microtubule based transport in general, with a focus on in vitro experiments, and on cooperative effects in the transportation of large cargos by multiple motors, we concentrate on axonal transport, because of its relevance for neuronal diseases. It is a challenge to understand how this transport is organized, given that it takes place in a confined environment and that several types of motors moving in opposite directions are involved. We review several features that could contribute to the efficiency of this transport, including the role of motor-motor interactions and of the dynamics of the underlying microtubule network. Finally, we discuss some still open questions. ",Intracellular transport driven by cytoskeletal motors: General   mechanisms and defects

"  Different theoretical and phenomenological aspects of the Minimal and Nonminimal Walking Technicolor theories have recently been studied. The goal here is to make the models ready for collider phenomenology. We do this by constructing the low energy effective theory containing scalars, pseudoscalars, vector mesons and other fields predicted by the minimal walking theory. We construct their self-interactions and interactions with standard model fields. Using the Weinberg sum rules, opportunely modified to take into account the walking behavior of the underlying gauge theory, we find interesting relations for the spin-one spectrum. We derive the electroweak parameters using the newly constructed effective theory and compare the results with the underlying gauge theory. Our analysis is sufficiently general such that the resulting model can be used to represent a generic walking technicolor theory not at odds with precision data.

"  We investigate the dependence of magnetic properties on the post-annealing temperature/time, the thickness of soft ferromagnetic electrode and Ta dusting layer in the pinned electrode as well as their correlation with the tunnel magnetoresistance ratio, in a series of perpendicular magnetic tunnel junctions of materials sequence Ta/Pd/IrMn/CoFe/Ta$(\textit{x})$/CoFeB/MgO$(\textit{y})$/CoFeB$(\textit{z})$/Ta/Pd. We obtain a large perpendicular exchange bias of 79.6$\,$kA/m for $x=0.3\,$nm. For stacks with $z=1.05\,$nm, the magnetic properties of the soft electrode resemble the characteristics of superparamagnetism. For stacks with $x=0.4\,$nm, $y=2\,$nm, and $z=1.20\,$nm, the exchange bias presents a significant decrease at post annealing temperature $T_\textrm{ann}=330\,^{\circ}$C for 60 min, while the interlayer exchange coupling and the saturation magnetization per unit area sharply decay at $T_\textrm{ann}=340\,^{\circ}$C for 60 min. Simultaneously, the tunnel magnetoresistance ratio shows a peak of $65.5\%$ after being annealed at $T_\textrm{ann}=300\,^{\circ}$C for 60 min, with a significant reduction down to $10\%$ for higher annealing temperatures ($T_\textrm{ann}\geq330\,^{\circ}$C) and down to $14\%$ for longer annealing times ($T_\textrm{ann}=300\,^{\circ}$C for 90 min). We attribute the large decrease of tunnel magnetoresistance ratio to the loss of exchange bias in the pinned electrode.

"  Kernel methods on discrete domains have shown great promise for many challenging data types, for instance, biological sequence data and molecular structure data. Scalable kernel methods like Support Vector Machines may offer good predictive performances but do not intrinsically provide uncertainty estimates. In contrast, probabilistic kernel methods like Gaussian Processes offer uncertainty estimates in addition to good predictive performance but fall short in terms of scalability. While the scalability of Gaussian processes can be improved using sparse inducing point approximations, the selection of these inducing points remains challenging. We explore different techniques for selecting inducing points on discrete domains, including greedy selection, determinantal point processes, and simulated annealing. We find that simulated annealing, which can select inducing points that are not in the training set, can perform competitively with support vector machines and full Gaussian processes on synthetic data, as well as on challenging real-world DNA sequence data.

"  We discuss the quantum dynamics of a particle in static curved spacetimes in a coordinate representation. The scheme is based on the analysis of the squared energy operator E^2, which is quadratic in momenta and contains a scalar curvature term. Our main emphasis is on AdS spaces, where this term is fixed by the isometry group. As a byproduct the isometry generators are constructed and the energy spectrum is reproduced. In the massless case the conformal symmetry is realized as well. We show the equivalence between this quantization and the covariant quantization, based on the Klein-Gordon type equation in AdS. We further demonstrate that the two quantization methods in an arbitrary (N+1)-dimensional static spacetime are equivalent to each other if the scalar curvature terms both in the operator E^2 and in the Klein-Gordon type equation have the same coefficient equal to (N-1)/(4N).

The fact that these correspondences need not be injective nor surjective has interesting implications for the problem of classifying `boundary conditions'. In particular, I give a clear geometric derivation of the (topological) boundary state formalism and point out some of its limitations. Finally, I formulate the problem of classifying (on-shell) boundary extensions of a given closed topological field theory in purely algebraic terms and discuss their reducibility.

"  One of the goals of current particle physics research is to obtain evidence for new physics, that is, physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM), at accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. The searches for new physics are often guided by BSM theories that depend on many unknown parameters, which, in some cases, makes testing their predictions difficult. In this paper, machine learning is used to model the mapping from the parameter space of the phenomenological Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (pMSSM), a BSM theory with 19 free parameters, to some of its predictions. Bayesian neural networks are used to predict cross sections for arbitrary pMSSM parameter points, the mass of the associated lightest neutral Higgs boson, and the theoretical viability of the parameter points. All three quantities are modeled with average percent errors of 3.34% or less and in a time significantly shorter than is possible with the supersymmetry codes from which the results are derived. These results are a further demonstration of the potential for machine learning to model accurately the mapping from the high dimensional spaces of BSM theories to their predictions.

"  Amplify-and-forward two-way relay network (AFTWRN) was introduced to realize high-data rate transmission over the wireless frequency-selective channel. However, AFTWRC requires the knowledge of channel state information (CSI) not only for coherent data detection but also for the selfdata removal. This is partial accomplished by training sequence-based linear channel estimation. However, conventional linear estimation techniques neglect anticipated sparsity of multipath channel and thus lead to low spectral efficiency which is scarce in the field of wireless communication. Unlike the previous methods, we propose a sparse channel estimation method which can exploit the sparse structure and hence provide significant improvements in MSE performance when compared with traditional LS-based linear channel probing strategies in AF-TWRN. Simulation results confirm the proposed methods. ",Sparse Channel Estimation for Amplify-and-Forward Two-way Relay Network   with Compressed Sensing
"  We clearly show that the symplectic structures deformations lead, upon quantization, to quantum theories of non commutative fields. Two variants of deformations are considered. The quantization is performed and the modes expansions of the quantum fields are derived. The Hamiltonians are given and the degeneracies lifting induced by the deformation is also discussed. As illustration, we consider the noncommutative chiral boson fields in the context of fractional quantum Hall effect. A generalized fractional filling factor is derived and shown to reproduce the Jain Hall states. We also show that the coupling of left and right edge excitations of a quantum Hall sample, gives rise a noncommutative chiral boson theory. The coupling or the non-commutativity induces a shift of the chiral components velocities. A non linear dispersion relation is obtained corroborating some recent analytical and numerical analysis.

"  A brief overview is presented of recent work which investigates the time-dependent relaxation of charge and its spontaneous fluctuations on mesoscopic conductors in the proximity of gates. The leading terms of the low frequency conductance are determined by a capacitive or inductive emittance and a dissipative charge relaxation resistance. The charge relaxation resistance is determined by the ratio of the mean square dwell time of the carriers in the conductor and the square of the mean dwell time. The contribution of each scattering channel is proportional to half a resistance quantum. We discuss the charge relaxation resistance for mesoscopic capacitors, quantum point contacts, chaotic cavities, ballistic wires and for transport along edge channels in the quantized Hall regime. At equilibrium the charge relaxation resistance also determines via the fluctuation-dissipation theorem the spontaneous fluctuations of charge on the conductor. Of particular interest are the charge fluctuations in the presence of transport in a regime where the conductor exhibits shot noise. At low frequencies and voltages charge relaxation is determined by a nonequilibrium charge relaxation resistance. ",Charge Relaxation Resistances and Charge Fluctuations in Mesoscopic   Conductors
"  Learning text representation is crucial for text classification and other language related tasks. There are a diverse set of text representation networks in the literature, and how to find the optimal one is a non-trivial problem. Recently, the emerging Neural Architecture Search (NAS) techniques have demonstrated good potential to solve the problem. Nevertheless, most of the existing works of NAS focus on the search algorithms and pay little attention to the search space. In this paper, we argue that the search space is also an important human prior to the success of NAS in different applications. Thus, we propose a novel search space tailored for text representation. Through automatic search, the discovered network architecture outperforms state-of-the-art models on various public datasets on text classification and natural language inference tasks. Furthermore, some of the design principles found in the automatic network agree well with human intuition. ",TextNAS: A Neural Architecture Search Space tailored for Text   Representation
"  Dark photons are massive abelian gauge bosons that interact with ordinary photons via a kinetic mixing with the hypercharge field strength tensor. This theory is probed by a variety of different experiments and limits are set on a combination of the dark photon mass and kinetic mixing parameter. These limits can however be strongly modified by the presence of additional heavy degrees of freedom. Using the framework of dark effective field theory, we study how robust are the current experimental bounds when these new states are present. We focus in particular on the possible existence of a dark dipole interaction between the Standard Model leptons and the dark photon. We show that the presence of a dark dipole modifies existing supernov{\ae} bounds for cut-off scales up to $\mathcal{O}(10 - 100~\text{TeV})$. On the other hand, terrestrial experiments, such as LSND and E137, can probe cut-off scales up to $\mathcal{O}(3~\text{TeV})$. For the latter experiment we highlight that the bound extends down to vanishing kinetic mixing. ",Dark Photon bounds in the dark EFT
"  The rate of secondary charm-quark-pair production has been measured in 4.4 million hadronic Z0 decays collected by OPAL. By selecting events with three jets and tagging charmed hadrons in the gluon jet candidate using leptons and charged D* mesons, the average number of secondary charm-quark pairs per hadronic event is found to be (3.20+-0.21+-0.38)x10-2.

"  We demonstrate the feasibility to generate surrogates by Fourier-based methods for an incomplete data set. This is performed for the case of a CMB analysis, where astrophysical foreground emission, mainly present in the Galactic plane, is a major challenge. The shuffling of the Fourier phases for generating surrogates is now enabled by transforming the spherical harmonics into a new set of basis functions that are orthonormal on the cut sky. The results show that non-Gaussianities and hemispherical asymmetries in the CMB as identified in several former investigations, can still be detected even when the complete Galactic plane (|b| < 30{\deg}) is removed. We conclude that the Galactic plane cannot be the dominant source for these anomalies. The results point towards a violation of statistical isotropy.

"  This is a survey paper on the connection of enriched category theory over a quantale and tropical mathematics. Quantales or complete idempotent semirings, as well as matrices with coefficients in them, are fundamental objects in both fields. We first explain standard category-theoretic constructions on matrices, namely composition, right extension, right lifting and the Isbell hull. Along the way, we review known reformulations (due to Elliott and Willerton) of tropical polytopes, directed tight spans and the Legendre--Fenchel transform by means of these constructions, illustrating their ubiquity in tropical mathematics and related fields. We then consider complete semimodules over a quantale $\mathcal{Q}$, a tropical analogue of vector spaces over a field, and mention Stubbe's result identifying them with skeletal and complete $\mathcal{Q}$-categories. With the aim to bridge a gap between enriched category theory and tropical mathematics, we assume no knowledge in either field. ",Enriched categories and tropical mathematics
"  The computation of the fundamental group of the complement of an algebraic plane curve has been theoretically solved since Zariski-van Kampen, but actual computations are usually cumbersome. In this work, we describe the notion of Wirtinger presentation of such a group relying on the real picture of the curve and with the same combinatorial flavor as the classical Wirtinger presentation; we determine a significant family of curves for which Wirtinger presentation provides the required fundamental group. The above methods allow us to compute that fundamental group for an infinite subfamily of hypocycloids, relating them with Artin groups. ","Wirtinger curves, Artin groups, and hypocycloids"
  The coupling between single photon emitters and integrated photonic circuits is an emerging topic relevant for quantum information science and other nanophotonic applications. We investigate the coupling between a hybrid system of colloidal quantum dots and propagating gap modes of a silicon nitride waveguide system. We furthermore explore the density of optical states of the system by using a scanning probe technique and find that the quantum dots couple significantly to the photonic circuit. Our results indicate that a scalable slot-waveguide might serve as a promising platform in future developments of integrated quantum circuitry. ,Coupling colloidal quantum dots to gap waveguides
"  We provide a simple, unified proof of Birkhoff's theorem for the vacuum and cosmological constant case, emphasizing its local nature. We discuss its implications for the maximal analytic extensions of Schwarzschild, Schwarzschild(-anti)-de Sitter and Nariai spacetimes. In particular, we note that the maximal analytic extensions of extremal and over-extremal Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetimes exhibit no static region. Hence the common belief that Birkhoff's theorem implies staticity is false for the case of positive cosmological constant. Instead, the correct point of view is that generalized Birkhoff's theorems are local uniqueness theorems whose corollary is that locally spherically symmetric solutions of Einstein's equations exhibit an additional local killing vector field.

"  Two-particle angular correlations between unidentified charged trigger and associated particles are measured by the ALICE detector in p-Pb collisions at a nucleon-nucleon centre-of-mass energy of 5.02 TeV. The transverse-momentum range 0.7 $ < p_{\rm{T}, assoc} < p_{\rm{T}, trig} <$ 5.0 GeV/$c$ is examined, to include correlations induced by jets originating from low momen\-tum-transfer scatterings (minijets). The correlations expressed as associated yield per trigger particle are obtained in the pseudorapidity range $|\eta|<0.9$. The near-side long-range pseudorapidity correlations observed in high-multiplicity p-Pb collisions are subtracted from both near-side short-range and away-side correlations in order to remove the non-jet-like components. The yields in the jet-like peaks are found to be invariant with event multiplicity with the exception of events with low multiplicity. This invariance is consistent with the particles being produced via the incoherent fragmentation of multiple parton--parton scatterings, while the yield related to the previously observed ridge structures is not jet-related. The number of uncorrelated sources of particle production is found to increase linearly with multiplicity, suggesting no saturation of the number of multi-parton interactions even in the highest multiplicity p-Pb collisions. Further, the number scales in the intermediate multiplicity region with the number of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions estimated with a Glauber Monte-Carlo simulation.

"  Recently, it has been proposed that fruitful synergies may exist between Deep Learning (DL) and Case Based Reasoning (CBR); that there are insights to be gained by applying CBR ideas to problems in DL (what could be called DeepCBR). In this paper, we report on a program of research that applies CBR solutions to the problem of Explainable AI (XAI) in the DL. We describe a series of twin-systems pairings of opaque DL models with transparent CBR models that allow the latter to explain the former using factual, counterfactual and semi-factual explanation strategies. This twinning shows that functional abstractions of DL (e.g., feature weights, feature importance and decision boundaries) can be used to drive these explanatory solutions. We also raise the prospect that this research also applies to the problem of Data Augmentation in DL, underscoring the fecundity of these DeepCBR ideas.

"  Analytical treatments, formulated to predict the rate of the bainite transformation, define autocatalysis as the growth of the subunits at the bainite-austenite interface. Furthermore, the role of the stress-free transformation strain is often translated to a thermodynamic criterion that needs to be fulfilled for the growth of the subunits. In the present work, an elastic phase-field model, which elegantly recovers the sharp-interface relations, is employed to comprehensively explicate the effect of the elastic energy on the evolution of the subunits. The primary finding of the current analysis is that the role of eigenstrains in the bainite transformation is apparently complicated to be directly quantified as the thermodynamic constraint. It is realized that the inhomogeneous stress state, induced by the growth of the primary subunit, renders a spatially dependent ill- and well-favored condition for the growth of the secondary subunits. A favorability contour, which encloses the sections that facilitate the elastically preferred growth, is postulated based on the elastic interaction. Through the numerical analyses, the enhanced growth of the subunits within the favorability-contour is verified. Current investigations show that the morphology and size of the elastically preferred region respectively changes and increases with the progressive growth of the subunits.

"  Seismic attributes calculated by conventional methods are susceptible to noise. Conventional filtering reduces the noise in the cost of losing the spectral bandwidth. The challenge of having a high-resolution and robust signal processing tool motivated us to propose a sparse time-frequency decomposition while is stabilized for random noise. The procedure initiates by using Sparsity-based adaptive S-transform to regularize abrupt variations in frequency content of the nonstationary signals. Then, considering the fact that a higher amplitude of a frequency component results in a higher signal to noise ratio, an adaptive filter is applied to the time-frequency spectrum which is sparcified previously. The proposed zero adaptive filter enhances the high amplitude frequency components while suppresses the lower ones. The performance of the proposed method is compared to the sparse S-transform and the robust window Hilbert transform in estimation of instantaneous attributes by applying on synthetic and real data sets. Seismic attributes estimated by the proposed method is superior to the conventional ones in terms of its robustness and high resolution image. The proposed approach has a vast application in interpretation and identification of geological structures. ",Robust and high-resolution seismic complex trace analysis
"  We consider Yukawa theory in which the fermion mass is induced by a Higgs like scalar. In our model the fermion mass exhibits a temporal dependence, which naturally occurs in the early Universe setting. Assuming that the complex fermion mass changes as a tanh-kink, we construct an exact, helicity conserving, CP-violating solution for the positive and negative frequency fermionic mode functions, which is valid both in the case of weak and strong CP violation. Using this solution we then study the fermionic currents both in the initial vacuum and finite density/temperature setting. Our result shows that, due to a potentially large state squeezing, fermionic currents can exhibit a large oscillatory magnification. Having in mind applications to electroweak baryogenesis, we then compare our exact results with those obtained in a gradient approximation. Even though the gradient approximation does not capture the oscillatory effects of squeezing, it describes quite well the averaged current, obtained by performing a mode sum. Our main conclusion is: while the agreement with the semiclassical force is quite good in the thick wall regime, the difference is sufficiently significant to motivate a more detailed quantitative study of baryogenesis sources in the thin wall regime in more realistic settings.

"  To improve understanding of the physiology, ecology and regeneration requirements of black poplar (Populus nigra), a severely endangered tree species in Europe, we analysed the biochemical composition of seeds from 20 families derived from open pollination of 20 trees in two contrasting environments in France, along the Dr\^ome and Loire rivers. Significant between-family differences were detected. Total lipid contents differed qualitatively between seed of the two populations and were higher in Dr\^ome population (214 more or less 29.8 versus 172.72 more or less 19.77 mg.g\-1 dw). Soluble sugars were less abundant in seeds of the Dr\^ome population (78.78 more or less 10.01 versus 104.10 more or less 25.32 mg.g\-1 dw). The protein content (322 more or less 74.3 mg.g\-1 dw) and quantity of reserve proteins did not differ between seeds of the two populations. Measurements in three consecutive years showed that seeds of the Loire population had significantly higher dry weight (0.69 more or less 0.10 versus 0.45 more or less 0.10 mg.g\-1 dw), but this did not significantly affect the germination rate or root growth of the seedlings measured 5 days after sowing. However, one group of Loire seedlings had substantially longer juvenile roots than another group. Overall, the results suggest that intrinsic qualities of the seeds are not critical factors in early stages and in selection pressure of the species life cycle and recruitment.

"  The planar Hall effect of IrMn on an yttrium iron garnet (YIG = Y3Fe5O12) was measured in the magnetic field rotating in the film plane.

"  The charged particle multiplicities of two- and three-jet events from the reaction e+e- -> Z0 -> hadrons are measured for Z0 decays to light quark (uds) flavors. Using recent theoretical expressions to account for biases from event selection, results corresponding to unbiased gluon jets are extracted over a range of jet energies from about 11 to 30 GeV. We find consistency between these results and direct measurements of unbiased gluon jet multiplicity from upsilon and Z0 decays. The unbiased gluon jet data including the direct measurements are compared to corresponding results for quark jets. We perform fits based on analytic expressions for particle multiplicity in jets to determine the ratio r = Ng/Nq of multiplicities between gluon and quark jets as a function of energy. We also determine the ratio of slopes, r(1) = (dNg/dy)/(dNq/dy), and of curvatures, r(2) = (d2Ng/dy2)/(d2Nq/dy2), where y specifies the energy scale. At 30 GeV, we find r = 1.422 +/- 0.051, r(1) = 1.761 +/- 0.071 and r(2) = 1.98 +/- 0.13, where the uncertainties are the statistical and systematic terms added in quadrature. These results are in general agreement with theoretical predictions. In addition, we use the measurements of the energy dependence of Ng and Nq to determine an effective value of the ratio of QCD color factors, CA/CF. Our result, CA/CF = 2.23 +/- 0.14 (total), is consistent with the QCD value of 2.25. ",Particle multiplicity of unbiased gluon jets from e+e- three-jet events
"  We theoretically investigate a new kind of nonlinear magnetoresistance on the surface of three-dimensional topological insulators (TIs). At variance with the unidirectional magnetoresistance (UMR) effect in magnetic bilayers, this nonlinear magnetoresistance does not rely on a conducting ferromagnetic layer and scales linearly with both the applied electric and magnetic fields; for this reason, we name it bilinear magneto-electric resistance (BMER). We show that the sign and the magnitude of the BMER depends sensitively on the orientation of the current with respect to the magnetic field as well as the crystallographic axes -- a property that can be utilized to map out the spin texture of the topological surface states via simple transport measurement, alternative to the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES).

"  Natural selection favors the more successful individuals. This is the elementary premise that pervades common models of evolution. Under extreme conditions, however, the process may no longer be probabilistic. Those that meet certain conditions survive and may reproduce while others perish. By introducing the corresponding binary birth-death dynamics to spatial evolutionary games, we observe solutions that are fundamentally different from those reported previously based on imitation dynamics. Social dilemmas transform to collective enterprises, where the availability of free expansion ranges and limited exploitation possibilities dictates self-organized growth. Strategies that dominate are those that are collectively most apt in meeting the survival threshold, rather than those who succeed in exploiting others for unfair benefits. Revisiting Darwinian principles with the focus on survival rather than imitation thus reveals the most counterintuitive ways of reconciling cooperation with competition.

"  The ability of a researcher to re-identify (re-ID) an individual animal upon re-encounter is fundamental for addressing a broad range of questions in the study of ecosystem function, community and population dynamics, and behavioural ecology. In this review, we describe a brief history of camera traps for re-ID, present a collection of computer vision feature engineering methodologies previously used for animal re-ID, provide an introduction to the underlying mechanisms of deep learning relevant to animal re-ID, highlight the success of deep learning methods for human re-ID, describe the few ecological studies currently utilizing deep learning for camera trap analyses, and our predictions for near future methodologies based on the rapid development of deep learning methods. By utilizing novel deep learning methods for object detection and similarity comparisons, ecologists can extract animals from an image/video data and train deep learning classifiers to re-ID animal individuals beyond the capabilities of a human observer. This methodology will allow ecologists with camera/video trap data to re-identify individuals that exit and re-enter the camera frame.

"  Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) at present achieve remarkable performance in image classification tasks. However, current ConvNets cannot guarantee the capabilities of the mammalian visual systems such as invariance to contrast and illumination changes. Some ideas to overcome the illumination and contrast variations usually have to be tuned manually and tend to fail when tested with other types of data degradation. In this context, we present a new bio-inspired {entry} layer, M6, which detects low-level geometric features (lines, edges, and orientations) which are similar to patterns detected by the V1 visual cortex. This new trainable layer is capable of coping with image classification even with large contrast variations. The explanation for this behavior is the monogenic signal geometry, which represents each pixel value in a 3D space using quaternions, a fact that confers a degree of explainability to the networks. We compare M6 with a conventional convolutional layer (C) and a deterministic quaternion local phase layer (Q9). The experimental setup {is designed to evaluate the robustness} of our M6 enriched ConvNet model and includes three architectures, four datasets, three types of contrast degradation (including non-uniform haze degradations). The numerical results reveal that the models with M6 are the most robust in front of any kind of contrast variations. This amounts to a significant enhancement of the C models, which usually have reasonably good performance only when the same training and test degradation are used, except for the case of maximum degradation. Moreover, the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) is used to analyze and explain the robustness effect of the M6 feature maps under any kind of contrast degradations.

"  This note provides a short guide to dimensional analysis in Lorentzian and general relativity and in differential geometry. It tries to revive Dorgelo and Schouten's notion of 'intrinsic' or 'absolute' dimension of a tensorial quantity. The intrinsic dimension is independent of the dimensions of the coordinates and expresses the physical and operational meaning of a tensor. The dimensional analysis of several important tensors and tensor operations is summarized. In particular it is shown that the components of a tensor need not have all the same dimension, and that the Riemann (once contravariant and thrice covariant), Ricci (twice covariant), and Einstein (twice covariant) curvature tensors are dimensionless. The relation between dimension and operational meaning for the metric and stress-energy-momentum tensors is discussed; and the possible conventions for the dimensions of these two tensors and of Einstein's constant $\kappa$, including the curious possibility $\kappa = 8\pi G$ without $c$ factors, are reviewed.

"  Temporal-dissipative Kerr solitons are self-localized light pulses sustained in driven nonlinear optical resonators. Their realization in microresonators has enabled compact sources of coherent optical frequency combs as well as the study of dissipative solitons. A key parameter of their dynamics is the effective-detuning of the pump laser to the thermally- and Kerr-shifted cavity resonance. Together with the free spectral range and dispersion, it governs the soliton-pulse duration, as predicted by an approximate analytical solution of the Lugiato-Lefever equation. Yet, a precise experimental verification of this relation was lacking so far. Here, by measuring and controlling the effective-detuning, we establish a new way of stabilizing solitons in microresonators and demonstrate that the measured relation linking soliton width and detuning deviates by less than 1 % from the approximate expression, validating its excellent predictive power. Furthermore, a detuning-dependent enhancement of specific comb lines is revealed, due to linear couplings between mode-families. They cause deviations from the predicted comb power evolution, and induce a detuning-dependent soliton recoil that modifies the pulse repetition-rate, explaining its unexpected dependence on laser-detuning. Finally, we observe that detuning-dependent mode-crossings can destabilize the soliton, leading to an unpredicted soliton breathing regime (oscillations of the pulse) that occurs in a normally-stable regime. Our results test the approximate analytical solutions with an unprecedented degree of accuracy and provide new insights into dissipative-soliton dynamics.

"  The n-particle periodic Toda chain is a well known example of an integrable but nonseparable Hamiltonian system in R^{2n}. We show that Sigma_k, the k-fold singularities of the Toda chain, ie points where there exist k independent linear relations amongst the gradients of the integrals of motion, coincide with points where there are k (doubly) degenerate eigenvalues of representatives L and Lbar of the two inequivalent classes of Lax matrices (corresponding to degenerate periodic or antiperiodic solutions of the associated second-order difference equation). The singularities are shown to be nondegenerate, so that Sigma_k is a codimension-2k symplectic submanifold. Sigma_k is shown to be of elliptic type, and the frequencies of transverse oscillations under Hamiltonians which fix Sigma_k are computed in terms of spectral data of the Lax matrices. If mu(C) is the (even) Maslov index of a closed curve C in the regular component of R^{2n}, then (-1)^{\mu(C)/2} is given by the product of the holonomies (equal to +/- 1) of the even- (or odd-) indexed eigenvector bundles of L and Lmat.

In particular, we compute closed-form expressions for fundamental solutions of $\big({-}\Delta \pm \beta^2\big)$ on ${\mathbf H}_R^d$, $\big({-}\Delta+\beta^2\big)$ on ${\mathbf S}_R^d$, and present two candidate fundamental solutions for $\big({-}\Delta-\beta^2\big)$ on ${\mathbf S}_R^d$. Flat-space limits, with their corresponding asymptotic representations, are used to restrict proportionality constants for these fundamental solutions. In order to accomplish this, we summarize and derive new large degree asymptotics for associated Legendre and Ferrers functions of the first and second kind. Furthermore, we prove that our fundamental solutions on the hyperboloid are unique due to their decay at infinity.

We study the effects of interlayer hopping variations on Floquet flat bands and find that lattice relaxation favors their formation. Furthermore, we find that, once formed, the flat bands carry nonzero Chern numbers. We show that at currently known values of parameters, such topological flat bands can be realized using circularly polarized UV laser light.

Recently, charge sensitive probes have suggested that the kagome superconductors AV_3Sb_5 (A = K, Rb, Cs) exhibit unconventional chiral charge order, which is analogous to the long-sought-after quantum order in the Haldane model or Varma model. However, direct evidence for the time-reversal symmetry-breaking of the charge order remains elusive. Here we utilize state-of-the-art muon spin relaxation to probe the kagome charge order and superconductivity in KV_3Sb_5. We observe a striking enhancement of the internal field width sensed by the muon ensemble, which takes place just below the charge ordering temperature and persists into the superconducting state. Remarkably, the muon spin relaxation rate below the charge ordering temperature is substantially enhanced by applying an external magnetic field. We further show the multigap nature of superconductivity in KV_3Sb_5 and that the T_c/lambda_{ab}^{-2} ratio is comparable to those of unconventional high-temperature superconductors. Our results point to time-reversal symmetry breaking charge order intertwining with unconventional superconductivity in the correlated kagome lattice.

"  Stars are most likely to merge or collide in regions of the highest stellar densities, and our own Galactic Center contains many stars packed into a relatively small volume -- even the ambient stellar number density in the central 50 pc is quite high, ~10^3 stars pc^{-3}. More striking, the three compact young clusters in this region have central densities as high as 10^6 stars pc^{-3}. We discuss these extreme environments and the possibility that stellar mergers and collisions have recently occured there. In particular, we predict that at least one massive star in the Arches cluster has already experienced a stellar merger in its short lifetime. Further, the Pistol Star, in the nearby Quintuplet cluster, might owe its apparent relative youth to a rejuvinating stellar merger. Finally, the apparently young stars in the central arcsecond could be products of either collisions, inducing atmospheric stripping, or mergers.

"  The standard Poisson structure on the rectangular matrix variety M_{m,n}(C) is investigated, via the orbits of symplectic leaves under the action of the maximal torus T of GL_{m+n}(C). These orbits, finite in number, are shown to be smooth irreducible locally closed subvarieties of M_{m,n}(C), isomorphic to intersections of dual Schubert cells in the full flag variety of GL_{m+n}(C). Three different presentations of the T-orbits of symplectic leaves in M_{m,n}(C) are obtained - (a) as pullbacks of Bruhat cells in GL_{m+n}(C) under a particular map; (b) in terms of rank conditions on rectangular submatrices; and (c) as matrix products of sets similar to double Bruhat cells in GL_m(C) and GL_n(C). In presentation (a), the orbits of leaves are parametrized by a subset of the Weyl group S_{m+n}, such that inclusions of Zariski closures correspond to the Bruhat order. Presentation (b) allows explicit calculations of orbits. From presentation (c) it follows that, up to Zariski closure, each orbit of leaves is a matrix product of one orbit with a fixed column-echelon form and one with a fixed row-echelon form. Finally, decompositions of generalized double Bruhat cells in M_{m,n}(C) (with respect to pairs of partial permutation matrices) into unions of T-orbits of symplectic leaves are obtained.

"  I employ the van der Waals theory of Baus and coworkers to analyze the fast, adiabatic decay of a supercooled liquid in a closed vessel with which the solidification process usually starts. By imposing a further constraint on either the system volume or pressure, I use the maximum-entropy method to quantify the fraction of liquid that is transformed into solid as a function of undercooling and of the amount of a foreign gas that could possibly be also present in the test tube. Upon looking at the implications of thermal and mechanical insulation for the energy cost of forming a solid droplet within the liquid, I identify one situation where the onset of solidification inevitably occurs near the wall in contact with the bath.

"  Resource usage data, collected using tools such as TACC Stats, capture the resource utilization by nodes within a high performance computing system. We present methods to analyze the resource usage data to understand the system performance and identify performance anomalies. The core idea is to model the data as a three-way tensor corresponding to the compute nodes, usage metrics, and time. Using the reconstruction error between the original tensor and the tensor reconstructed from a low rank tensor decomposition, as a scalar performance metric, enables us to monitor the performance of the system in an online fashion. This error statistic is then used for anomaly detection that relies on the assumption that the normal/routine behavior of the system can be captured using a low rank approx- imation of the original tensor. We evaluate the performance of the algorithm using information gathered from system logs and show that the performance anomalies identified by the proposed method correlates with critical errors reported in the system logs. Results are shown for data collected for 2013 from the Lonestar4 system at the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) ",Tracking System Behaviour from Resource Usage Data
"  We review the scaling relations for the critical current density (Jc) in Nb3Sn wires and include recent findings on the variation of the upper critical field (Hc2) with temperature (T) and A15 composition. We highlight deficiencies in the Summers/Ekin relations, which are not able to account for the correct Jc(T) dependence. Available Jc(H) results indicate that the magnetic field dependence for all wires can be described with Kramer's flux shear model, if non-linearities in Kramer plots are attributed to A15 inhomogeneities. The strain (eps) dependence is introduced through a temperature and strain dependent Hc2*(T,eps) and Ginzburg- Landau parameter kappa1(T,eps) and a strain dependent critical temperature Tc(eps). This is more consistent than the usual Ekin unification, which uses two separate and different dependencies on Hc2*(T) and Hc2*(eps). Using a correct temperature dependence and accounting for the A15 inhomogeneities leads to a remarkable simple relation for Jc(H,T,eps). Finally, a new relation for s(eps) is proposed, based on the first, second and third strain invariants. ",A general scaling relation for the critical current density in Nb3Sn
"  We review relationships between coronal mass ejections (CMEs), EIT post eruption arcades, and the coronal neutral line associated with global magnetic field and magnetic clouds near the Earth. Our previous findings indicate that the orientation of a halo CME elongation may correspond to the orientation of the underlyig flux rope. Here we revisit these preliminary reports by comparing orientation angles of elongated LASCO CMEs, both full and partial halos, to the post eruption arcades. Based on 100 analysed events, it was found that the overwhelming majority of halo CMEs are elongated in the direction of the axial field of the post eruptio arcades. Moreover, this conclusion also holds for partial halo CMEs as well as for events that originate further from the disk center. This suggests that the projection effect does not drastically change the appearance of full and partial halos and their imagesstill bear reliable information about the underlying magnetic fields. We also compared orientations of the erupted fields near the Sun and in the interplanetary space and found that the local tiltof the coronal neutral line at 2.5 solar radii is well correlated with the magnetic cloud axis measured near the Earth. We suggest that the heliospheric magnetic fields significantly affect the propagating ejecta. Sometimes, the ejecta may even rotate so that its axis locally aligns itself with the heliospheric current sheet.

"  The vibrating string is a source of gravitational waves which requires novel computational techniques, based on the explicit construction of a conserved and renormalized (in a classical sense) energy-momentum tensor. The renormalization is necessary to take into account the effect of external constraints, which affect the emission considerably. Vibrating media offer in general a testing ground for reconciling conflicts between General Relativity and other branches of physics; however, constraints are absent in sources like the Weber bar, for which the standard covariant formalism for elastic bodies can also be applied. Our solution method is based on the linearized Einstein equations, but relaxes other usual assumptions like far-field approximation, spherical or plane wave symmetry, TT gauge and source without internal interference. The string solution is then adapted to give the radiation field of a transversal Alfven wave in a rarefied plasma, where the tension is produced by an external static magnetic field. Like for the string, the field strength turns out to be independent from the frequency. We give a preliminary example of a numerical solution based on parameters referred to Alfven waves in the solar corona. Further astrophysical applications require an extension of the solution procedure to second order in the amplitude, and consideration of border effects. Future work will also address numerical and analytical near-field solutions.

"  Optical pumping by blackbody radiation is a feature shared by all polar molecules and fundamentally limits the time that these molecules can be kept in a single quantum state in a trap. To demonstrate and quantify this, we have monitored the optical pumping of electrostatically trapped OH and OD radicals by room-temperature blackbody radiation. Transfer of these molecules to rotationally excited states by blackbody radiation at 295 K limits the $1/e$ trapping time for OH and OD in the $X^{2}\Pi_{3/2},v''=0,J''=3/2(f)$ state to 2.8 s and 7.1 s, respectively.

"  This topical review focuses on solid-state quantum-light sources which are fabricated in a deterministic fashion. In this framework we cover quantum emitters represented by semiconductor quantum dots, colour centres in diamond, and defect-/strain-centres in two-dimensional materials. First, we introduce the topic of quantum-light sources and non-classical light generation for applications in photonic quantum technologies, motivating the need for the development of scalable device technologies to push the field to real-world applications. In the second part, we summarize material systems hosting quantum emitters in the solid-state. The third part reviews deterministic fabrication techniques and comparatively discusses their advantages and disadvantages. The techniques are classified in bottom-up approaches, exploiting the site-controlled positioning of the quantum emitters themselves, and top-down approaches, allowing for the precise alignment of photonic microstructures to pre-selected quantum emitters. Special emphasis is put on the progress achieved in the development of in-situ techniques, which significantly pushed the performance of quantum-light sources towards applications. Additionally we discuss hybrid approaches, exploiting pick-and-place techniques or wafer-bonding. The fourth part presents state-of-the-art quantum-dot quantum-light sources based on the fabrication techniques presented in the previous sections, which feature engineered functionality and enhanced photon collection efficiency. The article closes by highlighting recent applications of deterministic solid-state-based quantum-light sources in the fields of quantum communication, quantum computing, and quantum metrology, and discussing future perspectives in the field of solid-state quantum-light sources.

"  This paper considers the multiaccess coded caching systems formulated by Hachem et al., including a central server containing $N$ files connected to $K$ cache-less users through an error-free shared link, and $K$ cache-nodes, each equipped with a cache memory size of $M$ files. Each user has access to $L$ neighbouring cache-nodes with a cyclic wrap-around topology. The coded caching scheme proposed by Hachem et al. suffers from the case that $L$ does not divide $K$, where the needed number of transmissions (a.k.a. load) is at most four times the load expression for the case where $L$ divides $K$.   Our main contribution is to propose a novel {\it transformation} approach to smartly extend the schemes satisfying some conditions for the well known shared-link caching systems to the multiaccess caching systems. Then we can get many coded caching schemes with different subpacketizations for multiaccess coded caching system. These resulting schemes have the maximum local caching gain (i.e., the cached contents stored at any $L$ neighbouring cache-nodes are different such that the number of retrieval packets by each user from the connected cache-nodes is maximal) and the same coded caching gain as the original schemes. Applying the transformation approach to the well-known shared-link coded caching scheme proposed by Maddah-Ali and Niesen, we obtain a new multiaccess coded caching scheme that achieves the same load as the scheme of Hachem et al. but for any system parameters. Under the constraint of the cache placement used in this new multiaccess coded caching scheme, our delivery strategy is approximately optimal when $K$ is sufficiently large. Finally, we also show that the transmission load of the proposed scheme can be further reduced by compressing the multicast message.

"  This paper deals with a class of time inconsistent stochastic linear quadratic (SLQ) optimal control problems in Markovian framework. Three notions, i.e., closed-loop equilibrium controls/strategies, open-loop equilibrium controls and their closed-loop representations, are characterized in unified manners. These results indicate clearer and deeper distinctions among these notions. For example, in particular time consistent setting, the open-loop equilibrium controls are fully characterized by first-order, second-order necessary optimality conditions, and become needlessly optimal, while the closed-loop equilibrium controls naturally reduce into closed-loop optimal controls.

"  Modified by a logarithmic term, the non-linear electrodynamics (NED) model of the Born-Infeld (BI) action is reconsidered. Unlike the standard BI action, this choice provides interesting integrals of the Einstein-NED equations. It is found that the spherical matching process for a regular black hole entails indispensable surface stresses that vanish only for a specific value of the BI parameter. This solution represents a classical model of an elementary particle whose radius coincides with the horizon. In flat space time, a charged particle becomes a conducting shell with a radius proportional to the BI parameter.

"  By considering a class of diagrams which has been overlooked also in the most recent literature on three-body forces, we extract a new contribution to the three-nucleon interaction which specifically acts on the triplet odd states of the two nucleon subsystem. In the static approximation, this 3N-force contribution is fixed by the underlying 2N interaction, so in principle there are no free parameters to adjust. The 2N amplitude however enters in the 3NF diagram in a form which cannot be directly accessed or constrained by NN phase-shift analysis. We conclude that this new 3N-force contribution provides a mechanism which implies that the presence of the third nucleon modifies the p-wave (and possibly the f-wave) components of the 2N subsystem in the triplet-isotriplet channels. ",Why is the three-nucleon force so odd?
"  The interplay between site dilution and quantum fluctuations in S=1 Heisenberg antiferromagnets on the square lattice is investigated using quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Quantum fluctuations are tuned by a single-ion anisotropy D. In the clean limit, a sufficiently large D>D_c = 5.65(2) J forces each spin into its m_S=0 state, and thus destabilizes antiferromagnetic order. In the presence of site dilution, quantum fluctuations are found to destroy N\'eel order before the percolation threshold of the lattice is reached, if D exceeds a critical value D^* = 2.3(2) J. This mechanism opens up an extended quantum-disordered Mott glass phase on the percolated lattice, characterized by a gapless spectrum and vanishing uniform susceptibility.

  We theoretically investigate the crystalline anisotropy of topological phase transitions in phase-controlled planar Josephson junctions (JJs) subject to spin-orbit coupling and in-plane magnetic fields. It is shown how topological superconductivity (TS) is affected by the interplay between the magnetic field and the orientation of the junction with respect to its crystallographic axes. This interplay can be used to electrically tune between different symmetry classes in a controlled fashion and thereby optimize the stability and localization of Majorana bound states in planar Josephson junctions. Our findings can be used as a guide for achieving the most favorable conditions when engineering TS in planar JJs and can be particularly relevant for setups containing non-collinear junctions which have been proposed for performing braiding operations on multiple Majorana pairs. ,Crystalline Anisotropic Topological Superconductivity in Planar   Josephson Junctions
"  Context: the space-borne missions CoRoT and Kepler have provided photometric observations of unprecedented quality. The study of solar-like oscillations observed in red giant stars by these satellites allows a better understanding of the different physical processes occurring in their interiors. In particular, the study of the mode excitation and damping is a promising way to improve our understanding of stellar physics that has, so far, been performed only on a limited number of targets. Aims: the recent asteroseismic characterization of the evolutionary status for a large number of red giants allows us to study the physical processes acting in the interior of red giants and how they are modify during stellar evolution. In this work, we aim to obtain information on the excitation and damping of pressure modes through the measurement of the stars' pressure mode widths and amplitudes and to analyze how they are modified with stellar evolution. The objective is to bring observational constraints on the modeling of the physical processes behind mode excitation and damping. Methods: we fit the frequency spectra of red giants with well defined evolutionary status using Lorentzians functions to derive the pressure mode widths and amplitudes. To strengthen our conclusions, we used two different fitting techniques. Results: pressure mode widths and amplitudes were determined for more than 5000 red giants. With a stellar sample two orders of magnitude larger than previous results, we confirmed that the mode width depends on stellar evolution and varies with stellar effective temperature. In addition, we discovered that the mode width depends on stellar mass. We also confirmed observationally the influence of the stellar metallicity on the mode amplitudes, as predicted by models.

"  We study a simple class of correlators with two heavy and two light operators both in the D1D5 CFT and in the dual AdS$_3 \times S^3 \times T^4$ description. On the CFT side we focus on the free orbifold point and discuss how these correlators decompose in terms of conformal blocks, showing that they are determined by protected quantities. On the gravity side, the heavy states are described by regular, asymptotically AdS$_3 \times S^3 \times T^4$ solutions and the correlators are obtained by studying the wave equation in these backgrounds. We find that the CFT and the gravity results agree and that, even in the large central charge limit, these correlators do not have (Euclidean) spurious singularities. We suggest that this is indeed a general feature of the heavy-light correlators in unitary CFTs, which can be relevant for understanding how information is encoded in black hole microstates.

"  The problems arising when quantizing systems with periodic boundary conditions are analysed, in an algebraic (group-) quantization scheme, and the ``failure"" of the Ehrenfest theorem is clarified in terms of the already defined notion of {\it good} (and {\it bad}) operators. The analysis of ``constrained"" Heisenberg-Weyl groups according to this quantization scheme reveals the possibility for new quantum (fractional) numbers extending those allowed for Chern classes in traditional Geometric Quantization. This study is illustrated with the examples of the free particle on the circumference and the charged particle in a homogeneous magnetic field on the torus, both examples featuring ``anomalous"" operators, non-equivalent quantization and the latter, fractional quantum numbers. These provide the rationale behind flux quantization in superconducting rings and Fractional Quantum Hall Effect, respectively.

"  We present 10 - 19 um moderate resolution spectra of ten M dwarfs, one L dwarf, and two T dwarf systems obtained with the Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) onboard the Spitzer Space Telescope.

A cloud-free model best fits our mid-infrared spectrum of the T1 dwarf epsilon Indi Ba, and we find that the NH3 feature in epsilon Indi Bb is best explained by a non-equilibrium abundance due to vertical transport in its atmosphere. We examined a set of objects (mostly M dwarfs) in multiple systems to look for evidence of emission features, which might indicate an atmospheric temperature inversion, as well as trace molecular species; however, we found no evidence of either.

"  Regular intrinsic brightness variations observed in many stars are caused by pulsations. These pulsations provide information on the global and structural parameters of the star. The pulsation periods range from seconds to years, depending on the compactness of the star and properties of the matter that forms its outer layers. Here, we report the discovery of more than a dozen of previously unknown short-period variable stars: blue large-amplitude pulsators. These objects show very regular brightness variations with periods in the range of 20-40 min and amplitudes of 0.2-0.4 mag in the optical passbands. The phased light curves have a characteristic sawtooth shape, similar to the shape of classical Cepheids and RR Lyrae-type stars pulsating in the fundamental mode. The objects are significantly bluer than main sequence stars observed in the same fields, which indicates that all of them are hot stars. Follow-up spectroscopy confirms a high surface temperature of about 30,000 K. Temperature and colour changes over the cycle prove the pulsational nature of the variables. However, large-amplitude pulsations at such short periods are not observed in any known type of stars, including hot objects. Long-term photometric observations show that the variable stars are very stable over time. Derived rates of period change are of the order of 10^-7 per year and, in most cases, they are positive. According to pulsation theory, such large-amplitude oscillations may occur in evolved low-mass stars that have inflated helium-enriched envelopes. The evolutionary path that could lead to such stellar configurations remains unknown. ",Blue large-amplitude pulsators as a new class of variable stars
"  We investigate mass shifts of charmonia driven by change of the gluon condensate below but near transition temperatures at finite baryonic chemical potential. Extending previous prescription on the relation between gluon condensates and thermodynamic quantities, we model the gluon condensates of hadronic matter at finite temperature and baryonic chemical potential such that the scalar gluon condensate fits with the latest lattice QCD data. By making use of the QCD sum rule and the second order Stark effect, we find that the smoother transition in the full QCD can lead to moderate mass shifts of charmonia even below the transition temperature. We also find larger mass shift at fixed temperature as chemical potential increases. Existing data on charmonium-charmonium ratio is found to be consistent with the statistical hadronization scenario including the obtained mass shift.

"  Multi-vehicle coordinated decision making and control can improve traffic efficiency while guaranteeing driving safety. Formation control is a typical multi-vehicle coordination method in the multi-lane scenario. Among the existing formation control methods, the formation switching process is predefined and the collision-free behavior of vehicles has not been considered and explained in detail. This paper proposes a formation control method for multiple Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) on multi-lane roads. Firstly, a bi-level planning framework is proposed to switch the structure of the formation in different scenarios smoothly and effectively. Secondly, the relative coordinate system is established and the conflict-free relative paths are planned in the upper level. Then, multi-stage trajectory planning and tracking are modeled and solved as an optimal control problem with path constraints in the lower level. Next, case study is conducted to verify the function of the proposed method in different scenarios. Finally, simulation in the lane-drop bottleneck scenario is carried out under different traffic volume and numerical results indicate that the proposed method can improve both traffic efficiency and fuel economy at high traffic volume.

"  We interpret recent measurements of the zero field muon relaxation rate in the frustrated magnetic pyrochlore Dy$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ as resulting from the quantum diffusion of muons in the substance. In this scenario, the plateau observed at low temperature ($<7$ K) in the relaxation rate is due to coherent tunneling of the muons through a spatially disordered spin state and not to any magnetic fluctuations persisting at low temperature. Two further regimes either side of a maximum relaxation rate at $T^* = 50$ K correspond to a crossover between tunnelling and incoherent activated hopping motion of the muon. Our fit of the experimental data is compared with the case of muonium diffusion in KCl. ",Possible Quantum Diffusion of Polaronic Muons in Dy$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ Spin   Ice
"  The use of information and communication technologies (ICT) to support long-term care is gaining attention, also in the light of population ageing. Known in Scandinavian countries under the term of welfare technology, it aims to increase the quality of life and independence of people with physical, psychological or social impairments. In Germany, a new form of psychiatric home treatment, inpatient equivalent treatment (IET), is offered since 2018. It should allow service users with severe mental health issues to stay in their familiar environment during crisis, while being treated in the same complexity and flexibility like in an inpatient unit. However, this change in delivering healthcare services leads to sociotechnical challenges, such as coordination of work, integration into existing healthcare workflows and ensuring continuity of care. Hence, the objective of this exploratory study is to examine how information and communication technologies (ICT) interact in the new setting and how this process can be improved. Further, we also ask how service users can participate in designing home treatment services. Methodologically, this study follows a qualitative research approach. Different methods including participant observation, interviews and focus groups were conducted to answer the research questions. Data was collected during a field visit at the psychiatric department of a German clinic in summer 2019. Field notes and interviews were analyzed using the R package for qualitative data analysis RQDA. A list of socio-technical challenges and opportunities related to IET were identified. New forms of communication, gaps in documentation practices and continuity of care are seen to be highly relevant for designing and implementing home treatment services in psychiatric care.

  Sub-Poissonian light generation in the non-degenerate three-wave mixing is studied numerically and analytically within quantum and classical approaches. Husimi Q-functions and their classical trajectory simulations are analysed to reveal a special regime corresponding to the time-stable sub-Poissonian photocount statistics of the sum-frequency mode. Conditions for observation of this regime are discussed. Theoretical predictions of the Fano factor and explanation of the extraordinary stabilization of the sub-Poissonian photocount behavior are obtained analytically by applying the classical trajectories. Scaling laws for the maximum sub-Poissonian behavior are found. Noise suppression levels in the non-degenerate vs degenerate three-wave mixing are discussed on different time scales compared to the revival times. It is shown that the non-degenerate conversion offers much better stabilization of the suppressed noise in comparison to that of degenerate process. ,Quantum versus classical descriptions of sub-Poissonian light generation   in three-wave mixing
"  We present a rotation curve (RC) of the inner Galaxy of the 1st quadrant at $10\deg \le l \le 50\deg ~ (R=1.3-6.2~{\rm kpc})$ with the highest spatial (2 pc) and velocity (1.3 km/s) resolutions. We used the ${^{12}}$CO(J=1-0)-line survey data observed with the Nobeyama 45-m telescope at an effective angular resolution of $20""$ (originally $15"")$, and applied the tangent-velocity method to the longitude-velocity diagrams by employing the Gaussian deconvolution of the individual CO-line profiles. A number of RC bumps, or local variation of rotation velocity, with velocity amplitudes $\pm \sim 9$ km/s and radial scale length $\sim 0.5-1$ kpc are superposed on the mean rotation velocity. The prominent velocity bump and corresponding density variation around $R\sim 4$ kpc in the tangential direction of the Scutum arm (4-kpc molecular arm) is naturally explained by an ordinary galactic shock wave in a spiral arm with small pitch angle, not necessarily requiring a bar-induced strong shock.

The procedure is shown explicitly for a code in which one qubit is mapped into five. The quantum networks obtained are fault tolerant, that is, they can function successfully even if errors occur during the error correction. Our construction is derived using a recently introduced group-theoretic framework for unifying all known quantum codes. ",Fault-Tolerant Error Correction with Efficient Quantum Codes
"  The ternary cluster decay of heavy nuclei has been observed in several experiments with binary coincidences between two fragments using detector telescopes (the FOBOS-detectors, JINR, Dubna) placed on the opposite sides from the source of fissioning nuclei. The binary coincidences at a relative angle of 180$^0$ deg. correspond to binary fission or to the decay into three cluster fragments by registration of two nuclei with different masses (e.g.$^{132}$Sn,$^{52-48}$Ca,$^{68-72}$Ni). This marks a new step in the physics of fission-phenomena of heavy nuclei. These experimental results for the collinear cluster tripartition (CCT), refer to the decay into three clusters of comparable masses. In the present work we discuss the various aspects of this ternary fission (FFF) mode. The question of collinearity is analysed on the basis of recent publications. Further insight into the possible decay modes is obtained by the discussion of the path towards larger deformation, towards hyper-deformation and by inspecting details of the potential energy surfaces (PES). In the path towards the extremely deformed states leading to ternary fission, the concept of deformed shells is most important. At the scission configuration the phase space determined by the PES's leads to the final mass distributions. The possibility of formation of fragments of almost equal size ($Z_i$ = 32, 34, 32, for $Z$=98) and the observation of several other fission modes in the same system can be predicted by the PES. The PES's show pronounced minima and valleys, namely for several mass/charge combinations of ternary fragments, which correspond to a variety of collinear ternary fission (multi-modal) decays. The case of the decay of $^{252}$Cf(sf,fff) turns out to be unique due to the presence of deformed shells in the total system and of closed shells in all three nuclei in the decay.

"  The combination of ultrawideband (UWB) radios and inertial measurement units (IMU) can provide accurate positioning. To ensure reliable communication, the radios are generally mounted at the extremities of a mobile system whereas the IMUs are located closer to the center of gravity for use in control, resulting in a spatial offset between the IMU and the UWB radio. Additionally, data from heterogeneous sensors can arrive at different time instants. The systematic fusion of data from multiple sources requires the temporal offset and spatial offset between the sensors to be known. An important aspect of calibration is the observability of the system state and identifiability of the system parameters. Estimating the state or parameters of a system that is otherwise unobservable or unidentifiable, can result in poor estimates. In this report, the local weak observability of the state and the identifiability of the temporal offset for a tightly-coupled UWB-aided inertial localization system is studied.

"  We propose, analyze, and implement interpolatory approximations and Filon-type cubature for efficient and accurate evaluation of a class of wideband generalized Fourier integrals on the sphere. The analysis includes derivation of (i) optimal order Sobolev norm error estimates for an explicit discrete Fourier transform type interpolatory approximation of spherical functions; and (ii) a wavenumber explicit error estimate of the order $\mathcal{O}(\kappa^{-\ell} N^{-r_\ell})$, for $\ell = 0, 1, 2$, where $\kappa$ is the wavenumber, $N$ is the number of interpolation/cubature points on the sphere and $r_\ell$ depends on the smoothness of the integrand. Consequently, the cubature is robust for wideband (from very low to very high) frequencies and very efficient for highly-oscillatory integrals because the quality of the high-order approximation (with respect to quadrature points) is further improved as the wavenumber increases. This property is a marked advantage compared to standard cubature that require at least ten points per wavelength per dimension and methods for which asymptotic convergence is known only with respect to the wavenumber subject to stable of computation of quadrature weights. Numerical results in this article demonstrate the optimal order accuracy of the interpolatory approximations and the wideband cubature.

"  We report on Chandra observations of a sample of 11 optically luminous (Mb<-28.5) quasars at z=3.96-4.55 selected from the Palomar Digital Sky Survey and the Automatic Plate Measuring Facility Survey. These are among the most luminous z>4 quasars known and hence represent ideal witnesses of the end of the ""dark age ''. Nine quasars are detected by Chandra, with ~2-57 counts in the observed 0.5-8 keV band. These detections increase the number of X-ray detected AGN at z>4 to ~90; overall, Chandra has detected ~85% of the high-redshift quasars observed with snapshot (few kilosecond) observations. PSS 1506+5220, one of the two X-ray undetected quasars, displays a number of notable features in its rest-frame ultraviolet spectrum, the most prominent being broad, deep SiIV and CIV absorption lines. The average optical-to-X-ray spectral index for the present sample (<alpha_ox>=-1.88+/-0.05) is steeper than that typically found for z>4 quasars but consistent with the expected value from the known dependence of this spectral index on quasar luminosity.   We present joint X-ray spectral fitting for a sample of 48 radio-quiet quasars in the redshift range 3.99-6.28 for which Chandra observations are available. The X-ray spectrum (~870 counts) is well parameterized by a power law with Gamma=1.93+0.10/-0.09 in the rest-frame ~2-40 keV band, and a tight upper limit of N_H~5x10^21 cm^-2 is obtained on any average intrinsic X-ray absorption. There is no indication of any significant evolution in the X-ray properties of quasars between redshifts zero and six, suggesting that the physical processes of accretion onto massive black holes have not changed over the bulk of cosmic time.

The magnetic field strength is varied over a wide range, including values that are larger than the upper critical field B_c2 of niobium. In agreement with recent theoretical predictions we find that in the NS sample the rms of the conductance fluctuations (CF) is by a factor of 2.8 +/- 0.4 larger than in the high field regime where the entire system is driven normal conducting. Further characteristics of the CF are discussed. ",Conductance fluctuations in mesoscopic normal-metal/superconductor   samples
"  The impressive power-law decay of the energy spectrum of cosmic rays over more than thirty orders of magnitude in intensity and for energies ranging over eleven decades between $\simeq 10^9 $eV and $\simeq 10^{20} $eV is actually dotted with small irregularities. These irregularities are highly valuable for uncovering and understanding the modes of production and propagation of cosmic rays. They manifest themselves through changes in the spectral index characterising the observed power laws. One of these irregularities, known as the \textit{ankle}, is subject to conflicting interpretations for many years. If contemporary observations characterising it have shed new lights, they are still far from being able to deliver all the story. The purpose of this contribution is to give an overview of the physics of cosmic rays in the energy range where the transition between Galactic and extragalactic cosmic rays is expected to occur, and to deliver several lines of thought about the origin of the ankle.

"  Let $g(x)$ be a fixed non-constant complex polynomial. It was conjectured by Schinzel that if $g(h(x))$ has boundedly many terms, then $h(x)\in \C[x]$ must also have boundedly many terms. Solving an older conjecture raised by R\'enyi and by Erd\""os, Schinzel had proved this in the special cases $g(x)=x^d$; however that method does not extend to the general case. Here we prove the full Schinzel's conjecture (actually in sharper form) by a completely different method. Simultaneously we establish an ""algorithmic"" parametric description of the general decomposition $f(x)=g(h(x))$, where $f$ is a polynomial with a given number of terms and $g,h$ are arbitrary polynomials. As a corollary, this implies for instance that a polynomial with $l$ terms and given coefficients is non-trivially decomposable if and only if the degree-vector lies in the union of certain finitely many subgroups of $\Z^l$.

"  The results of a long-term multiwavelength study of the powerful flat spectrum radio quasar 3C 454.3 using {\it Fermi}-LAT and Swift XRT/UVOT data are reported. In the $\gamma$-ray band, {\it Fermi}-LAT observations show several major flares when the source flux was $>10^{-5}\:{\rm photon\:cm^{-2}\:s^{-1}}$; the peak $\gamma$-ray flux above $141.6$ MeV, $(9.22\pm1.96)\times10^{-5}\:{\rm photon\:cm^{-2}\:s^{-1}}$ observed on MJD 55519.33, corresponds to $2.15\times10^{50}\:{\rm erg\:s^{-1}}$ isotropic $\gamma$-ray luminosity. The analysis of Swift XRT and UVOT data revealed a flux increase, although with smaller amplitudes, also in the X-ray and optical/UV bands. The X-ray emission of 3C 454.3 is with a hard spectral index of $\Gamma_{\rm X}=1.16-1.75$, and the flux in the flaring states increased up to $(1.80\pm0.18)\times10^{-10}{\rm erg\:cm^{-2}\: s^{-1}}$. Through combining the analyzed data, it was possible to assemble 362 high-quality and quasi-simultaneous spectral energy distributions of 3C 454.3 in 2008-2018 which all were modeled within a one-zone leptonic scenario assuming the emission region is within the broad line region, involving synchrotron, synchrotron self-Compton and external Compton mechanisms. Such an extensive modeling is the key for constraining the underlying emission mechanisms in the 3C 454.3 jet and allows to derive the physical parameters of the jet and investigate their evolution in time. The modeling suggests that during the flares, along with the variation of emitting electron parameters, the Doppler boosting factor increased substantially implying that the emission in these periods has most likely originated in a faster moving region.

"  We show a possibility that a color ferromagnetic state exists in SU(3) gauge theory of quark matter with two flavors. Although the state involves three types of unstable modes of gluons, all of these modes are stabilized by forming a quantum Hall state of one of the modes.

"  One-dimensional superlattices with modulated coupling constants show rich topological properties and tunable edge states. Beyond the dimeric case, probing the topological properties of superlattices is a challenge. Here we suggest a rather general method of bulk probing topological invariants in waveguide superlattices based on spatial displacement of discretized beams. A judiciously tailored initial beam excitation of the lattice, corresponding to superposition of Wannier functions, provides a direct measure of the band gap topological numbers. For a quadrimeric superlattice, a simple bulk probing method, which avoids Wannier states, is proposed to discriminate the existence of zero-energy topological edge states from non-topological ones ",Probing topological phases in waveguide superlattices

In each of the vacua of the quantum theory, the expectation values $\la$Tr$\Phi^p$$\ra$ are determined by a master matrix $\Phi_0$ with eigenvalue distribution $\rho_{GT}(\l)$. $\rho_{GT}(\l)$ is quite distinct from the eigenvalue distribution $\rho_{MM}(\l)$ of the corresponding large $N$ matrix model proposed by Dijkgraaf and Vafa. Nevertheless, it has a simple form on the auxiliary Riemann surface of the matrix model.

"  We study the interaction between capillary forces and deformation in the context of a deformable capillary adhesive: a clamped, tense membrane is adhered to a rigid substrate by the surface tension of a liquid droplet. We find that the equilibrium adhesive force for this elastocapillary adhesive is significantly enhanced in comparison to the capillary adhesion between rigid plates. In particular, the equilibrium adhesion force is orders of magnitude greater when the membrane is sufficiently deformed to contact the substrate. From a dynamic perspective, however, the formation of a fluid-filled dimple slows this approach to contact and means that stable attachment is only achieved if adhesion is maintained for a minimum time. The inclusion of a variable membrane tension (as a means of modifying the deformability) gives additional control over the system, allowing new detachment strategies to be explored.

"  Recent results from T2K, MINOS and Double CHOOZ all indicate a sizeable reactor angle theta_13 which would rule out conventional tri-bimaximal lepton mixing. However, it is possible to maintain the tri-bimaximal solar and atmospheric mixing angle predictions, theta_12 ~ 35 degrees, theta_23 ~ 45 degrees even for a quite sizeable reactor angle theta_13 ~ 8 degrees, using an ansatz called tri-bimaximal-reactor (TBR) mixing proposed by one of us some time ago. We propose an explicit A4 model of leptons based on the type I seesaw mechanism at both the effective and the renormalisable level which, together with vacuum alignment, leads to surprisingly accurate TBR neutrino mixing, with the second order corrections to mixing angles having small coefficients.

On the one hand, starting from AdS3 in the principal embedding, we show that the W3 x W3 symmetry is preserved upon turning on perturbatively spin 3 chemical potentials. On the other hand, starting from AdS3 in the diagonal embedding, we show that the W3^(2) x W3^(2) symmetry is preserved upon turning on finite spin 3/2 chemical potentials. We also make connections between the canonical Lagrangian formalism and integrability methods based on the third KdV (Boussinesq) hierarchy. ",W Symmetry and Integrability of Higher spin black holes
"  Many simulations of relativistic heavy ion collisions involve the switching from relativistic hydrodynamics to kinetic particle transport. This switching entails the sampling of particles from the distribution of energy, momentum and conserved currents provided by hydrodynamics. Usually this sampling ensures the conservation of these quantities only on the average, i.e. the conserved quantities may actually fluctuate among the sampled particle configurations and only their averages over many such configurations agree with their values from hydrodynamics. Here we apply a recently invented method [Oliinychenko, Koch; PRL 123, 18, 182302 (2019)] to ensure conservation laws for each sampled configuration in spatially compact regions (patches) and study their effects: from the well-known (micro-)canonical suppression of means and variances to little studied (micro-)canonical correlations and higher order fluctuations. Most of these effects are sensitive to the patch size. Many of them do not disappear even in the thermodynamic limit, when the patch size goes to infinity. The developed method is essential for particlization of stochastic hydrodynamics. It is useful for studying the chiral magnetic effect, small systems, and in general for fluctuation and correlation observables.

"  We call a manifold $k$-orientable if the $i^{th}$ Stiefel-Whitney class vanishes for all $i< 2^k$ ($k\geq 0$), generalising the notions of orientable (1-orientable) and spin (2-orientable). In \cite{Hoekzema2017} it was shown that $k$-orientable manifolds have even Euler characteristic (and in fact vanishing top Wu class), unless their dimension is $2^{k+1}m$ for some $m\geq 1$. This theorem is strict for $k=0,1,2,3$, but whether there exist 4-orientable manifolds with an odd Euler characteristic is an open question. This paper discusses the question of finding candidates for such a manifold $\mathfrak{X}^{32m}$. As part of our investigation we study the example of the three exceptional symmetric spaces known as Rosenfeld planes, which have odd Euler characteristic and are of dimension 32, 64 and 128. We perform computations of the action of the Steenrod algebra on the mod 2 cohomology of the first two of these manifolds with the use computer calculations. The first Rosenfeld plane, $(\mathbb{O} \otimes \mathbb{C})\mathbb{P}^{2}$, is 2-orientable but not 3-orientable and thus not an example of $\mathfrak{X}^{32}$. We show that the second Rosenfeld plane $(\mathbb{O} \otimes \mathbb{H})\mathbb{P}^{2}$ is 3-orientable and we present a condition under which is may be 4-orientable if the action of the Steenrod algebra is established further, and therefore it remains a potential candidate for $\mathfrak{X}^{64}$. No other clear candidate manifolds for $\mathfrak{X}^{32m}$ or in particular candidates for $\mathfrak{X}^{32}$ are known to the author.

"  We investigate the influence of intrinsic noise on stable states of a one-dimensional dynamical system that shows in its deterministic version a saddle-node bifurcation between monostable and bistable behaviour. The system is a modified version of the Schl\""ogl model, which is a chemical reaction system with only one type of molecule. The strength of the intrinsic noise is varied without changing the deterministic description by introducing bursts in the autocatalytic production step. We study the transitions between monostable and bistable behavior in this system by evaluating the number of maxima of the stationary probability distribution. We find that changing the size of bursts can destroy and even induce saddle-node bifurcations. This means that a bursty production of molecules can qualitatively change the dynamics of a chemical reaction system even when the deterministic description remains unchanged.

"  In recent years, there are great interests as well as challenges in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to recommendation systems (RS). In this paper, we summarize three key practical challenges of large-scale RL-based recommender systems: massive state and action spaces, high-variance environment, and the unspecific reward setting in recommendation. All these problems remain largely unexplored in the existing literature and make the application of RL challenging. We develop a model-based reinforcement learning framework, called GoalRec. Inspired by the ideas of world model (model-based), value function estimation (model-free), and goal-based RL, a novel disentangled universal value function designed for item recommendation is proposed. It can generalize to various goals that the recommender may have, and disentangle the stochastic environmental dynamics and high-variance reward signals accordingly. As a part of the value function, free from the sparse and high-variance reward signals, a high-capacity reward-independent world model is trained to simulate complex environmental dynamics under a certain goal. Based on the predicted environmental dynamics, the disentangled universal value function is related to the user's future trajectory instead of a monolithic state and a scalar reward. We demonstrate the superiority of GoalRec over previous approaches in terms of the above three practical challenges in a series of simulations and a real application.

  We reinterpret the Faddeev-Popov gauge-fixing procedure of Yang-Mills theories as the definition of a topological quantum field theory for gauge group elements depending on a background connection. This has the advantage of relating topological gauge-fixing ambiguities to the global breaking of a supersymmetry. The global zero modes of the Faddeev-Popov ghosts are handled in the context of an equivariant cohomology without breaking translational invariance. The gauge-fixing involves constant fields which play the role of moduli and modify the behavior of Green functions at subasymptotic scales. At the one loop level physical implications from these power corrections are gauge invariant. ,Gauge Group TQFT and Improved Perturbative Yang-Mills Theory
"  The recent advent of smart meters has led to large micro-level datasets. For the first time, the electricity consumption at individual sites is available on a near real-time basis. Efficient management of energy resources, electric utilities, and transmission grids, can be greatly facilitated by harnessing the potential of this data. The aim of this study is to generate probability density estimates for consumption recorded by individual smart meters. Such estimates can assist decision making by helping consumers identify and minimize their excess electricity usage, especially during peak times. For suppliers, these estimates can be used to devise innovative time-of-use pricing strategies aimed at their target consumers. We consider methods based on conditional kernel density (CKD) estimation with the incorporation of a decay parameter. The methods capture the seasonality in consumption, and enable a nonparametric estimation of its conditional density. Using eight months of half-hourly data for one thousand meters, we evaluate point and density forecasts, for lead times ranging from one half-hour up to a week ahead. We find that the kernel-based methods outperform a simple benchmark method that does not account for seasonality, and compare well with an exponential smoothing method that we use as a sophisticated benchmark. To gauge the financial impact, we use density estimates of consumption to derive prediction intervals of electricity cost for different time-of-use tariffs. We show that a simple strategy of switching between different tariffs, based on a comparison of cost densities, delivers significant cost savings for the great majority of consumers.

"  In this work we establish universal ensemble independent bounds on the mean and variance of the mutual information and channel capacity for imaging through a complex medium. Both upper and lower bounds are derived and are solely dependent on the mean transmittance of the medium and the number of degrees of freedom $N$. In the asymptotic limit of large $N$, upper bounds on the channel capacity are shown to be well approximated by that of a bimodal channel with independent identically Bernoulli distributed transmission eigenvalues. Reflection based imaging modalities are also considered and permitted regions in the transmission-reflection information plane defined. Numerical examples drawn from the circular and DMPK random matrix ensembles are used to illustrate the validity of the derived bounds. Finally, although the mutual information and channel capacity are shown to be non-linear statistics of the transmission eigenvalues, the existence of central limit theorems is demonstrated and discussed.

"  Khanna and Sudan \cite{KS11} studied a natural model of continuous time channels where signals are corrupted by the effects of both noise and delay, and showed that, surprisingly, in some cases both are not enough to prevent such channels from achieving unbounded capacity. Inspired by their work, we consider channels that model continuous time communication with adversarial delay errors. The sender is allowed to subdivide time into an arbitrarily large number $M$ of micro-units in which binary symbols may be sent, but the symbols are subject to unpredictable delays and may interfere with each other. We model interference by having symbols that land in the same micro-unit of time be summed, and we study $k$-interference channels, which allow receivers to distinguish sums up to the value $k$. We consider both a channel adversary that has a limit on the maximum number of steps it can delay each symbol, and a more powerful adversary that only has a bound on the average delay.   We give precise characterizations of the threshold between finite and infinite capacity depending on the interference behavior and on the type of channel adversary: for max-bounded delay, the threshold is at $D_{\text{max}}=\ThetaM \log\min{k, M}))$, and for average bounded delay the threshold is at $D_{\text{avg}} = \Theta(\sqrt{M \cdot \min\{k, M\}})$.

"  Recent proposals of measuring bipartite Renyi entropy experimentally involve techniques that hold exactly for non-interacting quantum particles. Here we consider the difference between such measurements and the actual Renyi entropy for ground state fermion ab initio molecular systems. To calculate various entanglement measures we extended several different techniques for use with variational Monte Carlo, Hartree-Fock and quantum chemistry methods. Our results show that in systems with strong electron correlations the Renyi entropy may not be accurately determined with the proposed measurements. In addition, we find significant physical insight can be gained by calculating entanglement properties in molecular systems. We see that the Renyi entropy and the entanglement Hamiltonian encode information about the character of the covalent bonds in a molecular system and that such information may lead to better descriptions of bonded systems that have been traditionally hard to describe with standard techniques. In particular our results for the C$_{2}$ dimer suggests all eight valence electrons play a significant role in covalent bonding.

"  We consider elastic resource provisioning in the cloud, focusing on in-memory key-value stores used as caches. Our goal is to dynamically scale resources to the traffic pattern minimizing the overall cost, which includes not only the storage cost, but also the cost due to misses. In fact, a small variation on the cache miss ratio may have a significant impact on user perceived performance in modern web services, which in turn has an impact on the overall revenues for the content provider that uses those services. We propose and study a dynamic algorithm for TTL caches, which is able to obtain close-to-minimal costs. Since high-throughput caches require low complexity operations, we discuss a practical implementation of such a scheme requiring constant overhead per request independently from the cache size. We evaluate our solution with real-world traces collected from Akamai, and show that we are able to obtain a 17% decrease in the overall cost compared to a baseline static configuration.

"  The classical Getzler rescaling theorem is extended to the transverse geometry of foliations. More precisely, a Getzler rescaling calculus, as well as a Block-Fox calculus of asymptotic operators, is constructed for all transversely spin foliations. This calculus applies to operators of degree $m$ globally times degree $\ell$ in the leaf directions, and is thus an appropriate tool for a better understanding of the index theory of transversely elliptic operators on foliations. The main result is that the composition of A$\Psi$DOs is again an A$\Psi$DO, and includes a formula for the leading symbol. ",A symbol calculus for foliations
"  Diamondoids are a unique form of carbon nanostructure best described as hydrogen-terminated diamond molecules. Their diamond-cage structures and tetrahedral sp3 hybrid bonding create new possibilities for tuning electronic band gaps, optical properties, thermal transport, and mechanical strength at the nanoscale. The recently-discovered higher diamondoids (each containing more than three diamond cells) have thus generated much excitement in regards to their potential versatility as nanoscale devices. Despite this excitement, however, very little is known about the properties of isolated diamondoids on metal surfaces, a very relevant system for molecular electronics. Here we report the first molecular scale study of individual tetramantane diamondoids on Au(111) using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. We find that both the diamondoid electronic structure and electron-vibrational coupling exhibit unique spatial distributions characterized by pronounced line nodes across the molecular surfaces. Ab-initio pseudopotential density functional calculations reveal that the observed dominant electronic and vibronic properties of diamondoids are determined by surface hydrogen terminations, a feature having important implications for designing diamondoid-based molecular devices.

"  Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have now been widely used for industry applications and also played more important roles in fundamental researches. Although most ANN hardware systems are electronically based, optical implementation is particularly attractive because of its intrinsic parallelism and low energy consumption. Here, we propose and demonstrate fully-functioned all optical neural networks (AONNs), in which linear operations are programmed by spatial light modulators and Fourier lenses, and optical nonlinear activation functions are realized with electromagnetically induced transparency in laser-cooled atoms. Moreover, all the errors from different optical neurons here are independent, thus the AONN could scale up to a larger system size with final error still maintaining in a similar level of a single neuron. We confirm its capability and feasibility in machine learning by successfully classifying the order and disorder phases of a typical statistic Ising model. The demonstrated AONN scheme can be used to construct various ANNs of different architectures with the intrinsic parallel computation at the speed of light.

"  In a recent paper, we proposed a new class of supersymmetric SO(10) models for neutrino masses where the TeV scale electroweak symmetry is SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R\times U(1)_{B-L} making the associated gauge bosons W_R and Z' accessible at the Large Hadron Collider. We showed that there exists a domain of Yukawa coupling parameters and symmetry breaking patterns which give an excellent fit to all fermion masses including neutrinos. In this sequel, we discuss an alternative Yukawa pattern which also gives good fermion mass fit and then study the predictions of both models for proton lifetime. Consistency with current experimental lower limits on proton life time require the squark masses of first two generations to be larger than ~ 1.2 TeV. We also discuss how one can have simultaneous breaking of both SU(2)_R\times U(1)_{B-L} and standard electroweak symmetries via radiative corrections.

"  The Hahn algebra encodes the bispectral properties of the eponymous orthogonal polynomials. In the discrete case, it is isomorphic to the polynomial algebra identified by Higgs as the symmetry algebra of the harmonic oscillator on the $2$-sphere. These two algebras are recognized as the commutant of a $\mathfrak{o}(2)\oplus\mathfrak{o}(2)$ subalgebra of $\mathfrak{o}(4)$ in the oscillator representation of the universal algebra $\mathcal{U}(\mathfrak{u}(4))$. This connection is further related to the embedding of the (discrete) Hahn algebra in $\mathcal{U}(\mathfrak{su}(1,1))\otimes\mathcal{U}(\mathfrak{su}(1,1))$ in light of the dual action of the pair $\big(\mathfrak{o}(4),\mathfrak{su}(1,1)\big)$ on the state vectors of four harmonic oscillators. The two-dimensional singular oscillator is naturally seen by dimensional reduction to have the Higgs algebra as its symmetry algebra. ",The Higgs and Hahn algebras from a Howe duality perspective
"  Searches for exoplanets with radial velocity techniques are increasingly sensitive to stellar activity. It is therefore crucial to characterize how this activity influences radial velocity measurements in their study of the detectability of planets in these conditions. In a previous work we simulated the impact of spots and plages on the radial velocity of the Sun. Our objective is to compare this simulation with the observed radial velocity of the Sun for the same period. We use Dopplergrams and magnetograms obtained by MDI/SOHO over one solar cycle to reconstruct the solar integrated radial velocity in the Ni line 6768 \AA. We also characterize the relation between the velocity and the local magnetic field to interpret our results. We obtain a stronger redshift in places where the local magnetic field is larger (and as a consequence for larger magnetic structures): hence we find a higher attenuation of the convective blueshift in plages than in the network. Our results are compatible with an attenuation of this blueshift by about 50% when averaged over plages and network. We obtain an integrated radial velocity with an amplitude over the solar cycle of about 8 m/s, with small-scale variations similar to the results of the simulation, once they are scaled to the Ni line. The observed solar integrated radial velocity agrees with the result of the simulation made in our previous work within 30%, which validates this simulation. The observed amplitude confirms that the impact of the convective blueshift attenuation in magnetic regions will be critical to detect Earth-mass planets in the habitable zone around solar-like stars.

"  Time-reversal symmetry breaking is a key feature of nearly all natural sounds, caused by the physics of sound production. While attention has been paid to the response of the auditory system to ""natural stimuli,"" very few psychophysical tests have been performed. We conduct psychophysical measurements of time-frequency acuity for both ""natural"" notes (sharp attack, long decay) and time-reversed ones. Our results demonstrate significantly greater precision, arising from enhanced temporal acuity, for such ""natural"" sounds over both their time-reversed versions and theoretically optimal gaussian pulses, without a corresponding decrease in frequency acuity. These data rule out models of auditory processing that obey a modified ""uncertainty principle"" between temporal and frequency acuity and suggest the existence of statistical priors for naturalistic stimuli, in the form of sharp-attack, long-decay notes. We are additionally able to calculate a minimal theoretical bound on the order of the nonlinearity present in auditory processing. We find that only matching pursuit, spectral derivatives, and reassigned spectrograms are able to satisfy this criterion. ",Minimal Bounds on Nonlinearity in Auditory Processing
"  We propose a method to annotate segmentation masks accurately and automatically using invisible marker for object manipulation. Invisible marker is invisible under visible (regular) light conditions, but becomes visible under invisible light, such as ultraviolet (UV) light. By painting objects with the invisible marker, and by capturing images while alternately switching between regular and UV light at high speed, massive annotated datasets are created quickly and inexpensively. We show a comparison between our proposed method and manual annotations. We demonstrate semantic segmentation for deformable objects including clothes, liquids, and powders under controlled environmental light conditions. In addition, we show demonstrations of liquid pouring tasks under uncontrolled environmental light conditions in complex environments such as inside the office, house, and outdoors. Furthermore, it is possible to capture data while the camera is in motion so it becomes easier to capture large datasets, as shown in our demonstration.

"  We study the effects of interorbital hopping on orbital fluctuations and Mott-Hubbard metal-insulator transition (MIT) in the two-orbital Hubbard model within the extended linearized dynamical mean-field theory. By mapping the model onto an effective model with different bandwidths through the canonical transformation, we find that at half-filling, the increases of the interorbital Coulomb interaction $U^{\prime}$ and the Hund's coupling $J$ drive the MIT, and the critical $J_{c}$ for MIT increases with the lift of the inter-orbital hopping integral $t_{ab}$. Meanwhile at quarter filling and in the strong correlation regime, the system without $t_{ab}$ exhibits MIT with the decreasing of $J$, and favors the orbital liquid ground state. However, the system transits from metal to insulator with the increasing of t$_{ab}$, accompanied with the rising of the orbital order parameter. These results show the important role of the interorbital hopping in the orbital fluctuation and orbital ordering.

"  Hot spots, or plasmoids, forming due to magnetic reconnection in current sheets, are conjectured to power frequent X-ray and near-infrared flares from Sgr A*, the black hole in the center of our Galaxy. It is unclear how, where, and when current sheets form in black-hole accretion disks. We perform axisymmetric general-relativistic resistive magnetohydrodynamics simulations to model reconnection and plasmoid formation in a range of accretion flows. Current sheets and plasmoids are ubiquitous features which form regardless of the initial magnetic field in the disk, the magnetization in the quasi-steady-state phase of accretion, and the spin of the black hole. Within 10 Schwarzschild radii from the event horizon, we observe plasmoids forming, after which they can merge, grow to macroscopic scales of the order of a few Schwarzschild radii, and are ultimately advected along the jet's sheath or into the disk. Large plasmoids are energized to relativistic temperatures via reconnection and contribute to the jet's limb-brightening. We find that only hot spots forming in magnetically arrested disks can potentially explain the energetics of Sgr A* flares. The flare period is determined by the reconnection rate, which we find to be between 0.01c and 0.03c in all cases, consistent with studies of reconnection in isolated Harris-type current sheets. We quantify magnetic dissipation and non-ideal electric fields which can efficiently inject non-thermal particles. We show that explicit resistivity allows for converged numerical solutions, such that the electromagnetic energy evolution and dissipation become independent of the grid scale for the extreme resolutions considered here.

"  The structure of the general, inhomogeneous solution of (bosonic) Einstein-matter systems in the vicinity of a cosmological singularity is considered. We review the proof (based on ideas of Belinskii-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz and technically simplified by the use of the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner Hamiltonian formalism) that the asymptotic behaviour, as one approaches the singularity, of the general solution is describable, at each (generic) spatial point, as a billiard motion in an auxiliary Lorentzian space. For certain Einstein-matter systems, notably for pure Einstein gravity in any spacetime dimension D and for the particular Einstein-matter systems arising in String theory, the billiard tables describing asymptotic cosmological behaviour are found to be identical to the Weyl chambers of some Lorentzian Kac-Moody algebras. In the case of the bosonic sector of supergravity in 11 dimensional spacetime the underlying Lorentzian algebra is that of the hyperbolic Kac-Moody group E(10), and there exists some evidence of a correspondence between the general solution of the Einstein-three-form system and a null geodesic in the infinite dimensional coset space E(10)/K (E(10)), where K (E(10)) is the maximal compact subgroup of E(10).

"  We suggest using Einstein's static universe metric for the metastable state after reheating, instead of the Friedman-Robertson-Walker spacetime. In this case strong static gravitational potential leads to the effective reduction of the Higgs vacuum expectation value, which is found to be compatible with the Standard Model first order electroweak phase transition conditions. Gravity could also increase the CP-violating effects for particles that cross the new phase bubble walls and thus is able to lead to the successful electroweak baryogenesis scenario.

"  Waveguide quantum electrodynamics offers a wide range of possibilities to effectively engineer interactions between artificial atoms via a one-dimensional open waveguide. While these interactions have been experimentally studied in the few qubit limit, the collective properties of such systems for larger arrays of qubits in a metamaterial configuration has so far not been addressed. Here, we experimentally study a metamaterial made of eight superconducting transmon qubits with local frequency control coupled to the mode continuum of a waveguide. By consecutively tuning the qubits to a common resonance frequency we observe the formation of super- and subradiant states, as well as the emergence of a polaritonic bandgap. Making use of the qubits quantum nonlinearity, we demonstrate control over the latter by inducing a transparency window in the bandgap region of the ensemble. The circuit of this work extends experiments with one and two qubits towards a full-blown quantum metamaterial, thus paving the way for large-scale applications in superconducting waveguide quantum electrodynamics.

"  We consider MSSM with right-chiral neutrino superfields with Majorana masses, where the lightest right-handed sneutrino dominated scalars constitutes non-thermal dark matter (DM). The $\Delta\,L=2$ masses are subject to severe constraints coming from freeze-in relic density of such DM candidates as well as from sterile neutrino $\textit{freeze-in}$. In addition, big-bang Nucleosynthesis and $\textit{freeze-out}$ of the next-to-lightest superparticle shrink the viable parameter space of such a scenario. We examine various $\Delta\,L=2$ mass terms for families other than that $\Delta\,L=2$ masses are difficult to reconcile with a right-sneutrino DM, unless there is either (a) a hierarchy of about 3 orders of magnitudes among various supersymmetry-breaking mass parameters, or, (b) strong cancellation between the higgsino mass and the trilinear supersymmetry breaking mass parameter for sneutrinos.

"  The superconducting LHC magnets are coupled with an electronic monitoring system which records and analyses voltage time series reflecting their performance. A currently used system is based on a range of preprogrammed triggers which launches protection procedures when a misbehavior of the magnets is detected. All the procedures used in the protection equipment were designed and implemented according to known working scenarios of the system and are updated and monitored by human operators.   This paper proposes a novel approach to monitoring and fault protection of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) superconducting magnets which employs state-of-the-art Deep Learning algorithms. Consequently, the authors of the paper decided to examine the performance of LSTM recurrent neural networks for modeling of voltage time series of the magnets. In order to address this challenging task different network architectures and hyper-parameters were used to achieve the best possible performance of the solution. The regression results were measured in terms of RMSE for different number of future steps and history length taken into account for the prediction. The best result of RMSE=0.00104 was obtained for a network of 128 LSTM cells within the internal layer and 16 steps history buffer.

"  We study the Neumann Laplacian operator $-\Delta_\Omega^N$ restricted to a twisted waveguide $\Omega$. The goal is to find the effective operator when the diameter of $\Omega$ tends to zero. However, when $\Omega$ is ""squeezed"" there are divergent eigenvalues due to the transverse oscillations. We show that each one of these eigenvalues influences the action of the effective operator in a different way. In the case where $\Omega$ is periodic and sufficiently thin, we find information about the absolutely continuous spectrum of $-\Delta_\Omega^N$ and the existence and location of band gaps in its structure.

"  Molecular beam epitaxy technique has been used to deposit a single layer and a bilayer of MoSe 2 on sapphire. Extensive characterizations including in-situ and ex-situ measurements show that the layered MoSe 2 grows in a scalable manner on the substrate and reveals characteristics of a stoichiometric 2H-phase. The layered MoSe 2 exhibits polycrystalline features with domains separated by defects and boundaries. Temperature and magnetic field dependent resistivity measurements unveil a carrier hopping character described within two-dimensional variable range hopping mechanism. Moreover, a negative magnetoresistance was observed, stressing a fascinating feature of the charge transport under the application of a magnetic field in the layered MoSe 2 system. This negative magnetoresistance observed at millimeter-scale is similar to that observed recently at room temperature inWS2 flakes at a micrometer scale [Zhang et al., Appl. Phys.

"  The well known Boole-Shannon expansion of Boolean functions in several variables (with co-efficients in a Boolean algebra $B$) is also known in more general form in terms of expansion in a set $\Phi$ of orthonormal functions. However, unlike the one variable step of this expansion an analogous elimination theorem and consistency is not well known. This article proves such an elimination theorem for a special class of Boolean functions denoted $B(\Phi)$. When the orthonormal set $\Phi$ is of polynomial size in number $n$ of variables, the consistency of a Boolean equation $f=0$ can be determined in polynomial number of $B$-operations. A characterization of $B(\Phi)$ is also shown and an elimination based procedure for computing consistency of Boolean equations is proposed.

"  We analyze the potential of the $c$-plane InGaN/GaN quantum dots for polarization entangled photon emission by means of an atomistic many-body framework. Special attention is paid to the impact of random alloy fluctuations on the excitonic fine structure and the excitonic binding energy. Our calculations show that $c$-plane InGaN/GaN quantum dots are ideal candidates for high temperature entangled photon emission as long as the underlying $C_{3v}$-symmetry is preserved. However, when assuming random alloy fluctuations in the dot, our atomistic calculations reveal that while the large excitonic binding energies are only slightly affected, the $C_{3v}$ symmetry is basically lost due to the alloy fluctuations. We find that this loss in symmetry significantly impacts the excitonic fine structure. The observed changes in fine structure and the accompanied light polarization characteristics have a detrimental effect for polarization entangled photon pair emission via the biexciton-exciton cascade. Here, we also discuss possible alternative schemes that benefit from the large excitonic binding energies, to enable non-classical light emission from $c$-plane InGaN/GaN quantum dots at elevated temperatures.

"  Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity is form of learning that has been demonstrated in real cortical tissue, but attempts to use it for artificial systems have not produced good results. This paper seeks to remedy this with two significant advances. The first is the development a simple stochastic learning rule called cyclic STDP that can extract patterns encoded in the precise spiking times of a group of neurons. We show that a population of neurons endowed with this learning rule can act as an effective short-term associative memory, storing and reliably recalling a large set of pattern associations over an extended period of time.   The second major theme examines the challenges associated with training a neuron to produce a spike at a precise time and for the fidelity of spike recall time to be maintained as further learning occurs. The strong constraint of working with precisely-timed spikes (so-called temporal coding) is mandated by the learning rule but is also consistent with the believe in the necessity of such an encoding scheme to render a spiking neural network a competitive solution for flexible intelligent systems in continuous learning environments.   The encoding and learning rules are demonstrated in the design of a single-layer associative memory (an input layer consisting of 3,200 spiking neurons fully-connected to a similar sized population of memory neurons), which we simulate and characterise. Design considerations and clarification of the role of parameters under the control of the designer are explored. ",Spiking Associative Memory for Spatio-Temporal Patterns

  According to a theorem of Eliashberg and Thurston a $C^2$-foliation on a closed 3-manifold can be $C^0$-approximated by contact structures unless all leaves of the foliation are spheres. Examples on the 3-torus show that every neighbourhood of a foliation can contain non-diffeomorphic contact structures.   In this paper we show uniqueness up to isotopy of the contact structure in a small neighbourhood of the foliation when the foliation has no torus leaf and is not a foliation without holonomy on parabolic torus bundles over the circle. This allows us to associate invariants from contact topology to foliations. As an application we show that the space of taut foliations in a given homotopy class of plane fields is not connected in general. ,Uniqueness of the contact structure approximating a foliation

"  In this paper, we consider solving discounted Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) under the constraint that the resulting policy is stabilizing. In practice MDPs are solved based on some form of policy approximation. We will leverage recent results proposing to use Model Predictive Control (MPC) as a structured policy in the context of Reinforcement Learning to make it possible to introduce stability requirements directly inside the MPC-based policy. This will restrict the solution of the MDP to stabilizing policies by construction. The stability theory for MPC is most mature for the undiscounted MPC case. Hence, we will first show in this paper that stable discounted MDPs can be reformulated as undiscounted ones. This observation will entail that the MPC-based policy with stability requirements will produce the optimal policy for the discounted MDP if it is stable, and the best stabilizing policy otherwise.

"  The progress of deep learning (DL), especially the recent development of automatic design of networks, has brought unprecedented performance gains at heavy computational cost. On the other hand, blockchain systems routinely perform a huge amount of computation that does not achieve practical purposes in order to build Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus from decentralized participants. In this paper, we propose a new consensus mechanism, Proof of Learning (PoLe), which directs the computation spent for consensus toward optimization of neural networks (NN). In our mechanism, the training/testing data are released to the entire blockchain network (BCN) and the consensus nodes train NN models on the data, which serves as the proof of learning. When the consensus on the BCN considers a NN model to be valid, a new block is appended to the blockchain. We experimentally compare the PoLe protocol with Proof of Work (PoW) and show that PoLe can achieve a more stable block generation rate, which leads to more efficient transaction processing. We also introduce a novel cheating prevention mechanism, Secure Mapping Layer (SML), which can be straightforwardly implemented as a linear NN layer. Empirical evaluation shows that SML can detect cheating nodes at small cost to the predictive performance.

"  There are two commonly discussed points of view in theoretical description of cuprate superconductors, (i) Cuprates can be described by the modified t-J model. (ii) Overdoped cuprates are close to the regime of normal Fermi liquid (NFL). We argue that recent resonant inelastic X-ray scattering data challenge both points. While the modified t-J model describes well the strongly underdoped regime, it fails to describe high energy magnetic excitations when approaching optimal doping. This probably indicates failure of the Zhang-Rice singlet picture. In the overdoped regime the momentum-integrated spin structure factor S(\omega) has the same intensity and energy distribution as that in an undoped parent compound. This implies that the entire spin spectral sum rule is saturated at \omega ~ 2J, while in a NFL the spectral weight should saturate only at the total bandwidth which is much larger than 2J.

Down to T=9 K, $\nu$ becomes independent of field by $H \simeq 30$ T, showing that superconducting fluctuations have become negligible. In this field-induced normal state, $S/T$ and $\nu/T$ are both large and negative in the $T \to 0$ limit, with the magnitude and sign of $S/T$ consistent with the small electron-like Fermi surface pocket detected previously by quantum oscillations and the Hall effect. The change of sign in $S(T)$ at $T \simeq 50$ K is remarkably similar to that observed in La$_{2-x}$Ba$_x$CuO$_4$, La$_{2-x-y}$Nd$_y$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ and La$_{2-x-y}$Eu$_y$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$, where it is clearly associated with the onset of stripe order.

"  We present the results of a linear optics photonic implementation of a quantum circuit that simulates a phase covariant cloner, by using two different degrees of freedom of a single photon. We experimentally simulate the action of two mirrored $1\rightarrow 2$ cloners, each of them biasing the cloned states into opposite regions of the Bloch sphere. We show that by applying a random sequence of these two cloners, an eavesdropper can mitigate the amount of noise added to the original input state and therefore prepare clones with no bias but with the same individual fidelity, masking its presence in a quantum key distribution protocol. Input polarization qubit states are cloned into path qubit states of the same photon, which is identified as a potential eavesdropper in a quantum key distribution protocol. The device has the flexibility to produce mirrored versions that optimally clone states on either the northern or southern hemispheres of the Bloch sphere, as well as to simulate optimal and non-optimal cloning machines by tuning the asymmetry on each of the cloning machines.

"  We have detected likely z~7-8 galaxies in the 144""x144"" NICMOS observations of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. Objects are required to be >3 sigma detections in both NICMOS bands, J and H. The selection criteria for this sample are (z-J)>0.8, (z-J) > 0.66 (J-H)+0.8, (J-H)<1.2, and no detection at <8500 Angstroms. The 5 selected sources have total magnitudes H~27. Four of the five sources are quite blue compared to typical lower-redshift dropout galaxies and are clustered within a 1 arcmin**2 region. Because all 5 sources are near the limit of the NICMOS data, we have carefully evaluated their reality. Each of the candidates is visible in different splits of the data and a median stack. We analyzed several noise images and estimate the number of spurious sources to be 1+/-1. A search using an independent reduction of this same data set clearly revealed 3 of the 5 candidates and weakly detected a 4th candidate, suggesting the contamination could be higher. For comparison with predictions from lower redshift samples we take a conservative approach and adopt four z~7-8 galaxies as our sample. With the same detection criteria on simulated datasets, assuming no-evolution from z~3.8, we predict 10 sources at z~7-8, or 14 if we use a more realistic (1+z)^{-1} size scaling. We estimate that the rest-frame continuum UV (~1800 Angstroms) luminosity density at z~7.5 (integrated down to 0.3L*) is just 0.20_{-0.08}^{+0.12}x that found at z~3.8. Effectively this sets an upper limit on the luminosity density down to 0.3 L*. This result is consistent with significant evolution at the bright end of the luminosity function from z~7.5 to z~3.8. Even with the lower UV luminosity density at z~7.5, it appears that galaxies could still play an important role in reionization at these redshifts, though definitive measurements remain to be made.

"  Based upon the idea that network functionality is impaired if two nodes in a network are sufficiently separated in terms of a given metric, we introduce two combinatorial \emph{pseudocut} problems generalizing the classical min-cut and multi-cut problems. We expect the pseudocut problems will find broad relevance to the study of network reliability. We comprehensively analyze the computational complexity of the pseudocut problems and provide three approximation algorithms for these problems.   Motivated by applications in communication networks with strict Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements, we demonstrate the utility of the pseudocut problems by proposing a targeted vulnerability assessment for the structure of communication networks using QoS metrics; we perform experimental evaluations of our proposed approximation algorithms in this context.

Then we obtain recursive formulas for the power moments of Kloosterman sums with square arguments and for the even power moments of those in terms of the frequencies of weights in the codes.

"  Multi-modal machine learning (ML) models can process data in multiple modalities (e.g., video, audio, text) and are useful for video content analysis in a variety of problems (e.g., object detection, scene understanding, activity recognition). In this paper, we focus on the problem of video categorization using a multi-modal ML technique. In particular, we have developed a novel multi-modal ML approach that we call ""cross-modal learning"", where one modality influences another but only when there is correlation between the modalities -- for that, we first train a correlation tower that guides the main multi-modal video categorization tower in the model. We show how this cross-modal principle can be applied to different types of models (e.g., RNN, Transformer, NetVLAD), and demonstrate through experiments how our proposed multi-modal video categorization models with cross-modal learning out-perform strong state-of-the-art baseline models.

"  We explore the possibility that, in a quantum field theory with Planck scale cutoff Lambda=Mp, observable quantities for low-energy processes respect the Lorentz symmetry. In particular, we compute the one-loop radiative correction Pi to the self-energy of a scalar field with lambda phi^4 interaction, using a modified (non-invariant) propagator which vanishes in the trans-Planckian regime, as expected in the ""classicalization"" scenario. We then show that, by imposing the result does not depend on Lambda (in the limit Lambda to Mp), an explicit (albeit not unique) expression for Pi can be derived, which is similar to the one simply obtained with the standard Feynman propagator and a cutoff Lambda=Mp.

"  This paper provides a comprehensive estimation framework via nuclear norm plus $l_1$ norm penalization for high-dimensional approximate factor models with a sparse residual covariance. The underlying assumptions allow for non-pervasive latent eigenvalues and a prominent residual covariance pattern. In that context, existing approaches based on principal components may lead to misestimate the latent rank, due to the numerical instability of sample eigenvalues. On the contrary, the proposed optimization problem retrieves the latent covariance structure and exactly recovers the latent rank and the residual sparsity pattern. Conditioning on them, the asymptotic rates of the subsequent ordinary least squares estimates of loadings and factor scores are provided, the recovered latent eigenvalues are shown to be maximally concentrated and the estimates of factor scores via Bartlett's and Thompson's methods are proved to be the most precise given the data. The validity of outlined results is highlighted in an exhaustive simulation study and in a real financial data example. ",Large factor model estimation by nuclear norm plus $l_1$ norm   penalization
"  Plasma energization through magnetic reconnection in the magnetically-dominated regime featured by low plasma beta ($\beta = 8 \pi nkT_0/B^2 \ll 1$) and/or high magnetization ($\sigma = B^2/(4 \pi nmc^2) \gg 1$) is important in a series of astrophysical systems such as solar flares, pulsar wind nebula, and relativistic jets from black holes, etc. In this paper, we review the recent progress on kinetic simulations of this process and further discuss plasma dynamics and particle acceleration in a low-$\beta$ reconnection layer that consists of electron-positron pairs. We also examine the effect of different initial thermal temperatures on the resulting particle energy spectra. While earlier papers have concluded that the spectral index is smaller for higher $\sigma$, our simulations show that the spectral index approaches $p=1$ for sufficiently low plasma $\beta$, even if $\sigma \sim 1$. Since this predicted spectral index in the idealized limit is harder than most observations, it is important to consider effects that can lead to a softer spectrum such as open boundary simulations. We also remark that the effects of 3D reconnection physics and turbulence on reconnection need to be addressed in the future.

"  Supermassive black hole binaries, cosmic strings, relic gravitational waves from inflation, and first order phase transitions in the early universe are expected to contribute to a stochastic background of gravitational waves in the 10^(-9) Hz-10^(-7) Hz frequency band. Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) exploit the high precision timing of radio pulsars to detect signals at such frequencies. Here we present a time-domain implementation of the optimal cross-correlation statistic for stochastic background searches in PTA data. Due to the irregular sampling typical of PTA data as well as the use of a timing model to predict the times-of-arrival of radio pulses, time-domain methods are better suited for gravitational wave data analysis of such data. We present a derivation of the optimal cross-correlation statistic starting from the likelihood function, a method to produce simulated stochastic background signals, and a rigorous derivation of the scaling laws for the signal-to-noise ratio of the cross-correlation statistic in the two relevant PTA regimes: the weak signal limit where instrumental noise dominates over the gravitational wave signal at all frequencies, and a second regime where the gravitational wave signal dominates at the lowest frequencies.

"  Antiferromagnetic topological insulator (AFTI) is a topological matter that breaks time-reversal symmetry. Since its proposal, explorations of AFTI in strong-correlated systems are still lacking. In this paper, we show for the first time that a novel AFTI phase can be realized in three-dimensional topological Kondo insulator (TKI). In a wide parameter region, the ground states of TKI undergo a second-order transition to antiferromagnetic insulating phases which conserve a combined symmetry of time reversal and a lattice translation, allowing us to derive a $\mathcal{Z}_2$-classification formula for these states. By calculating the $\mathcal{Z}_2$ index, the antiferromagnetic insulating states are classified into (AFTI) or non-topological antiferromagnetic insulator (nAFI) in different parameter regions. On the antiferromagnetic surfaces in AFTI, we find topologically protected gapless Dirac cones inside the bulk gap, leading to metallic Fermi rings exhibiting helical spin texture with weak spin-momentum locking. Depending on model parameters, the magnetic transitions take place either between AFTI and strong topological insulator, or between nAFI and weak topological insulator. By varying some model parameters, we find a topological transition between AFTI and nAFI, driving by closing of bulk gap. Our work may account for the pressure-induced magnetism in TKI compound SmB$_6$, and helps to explore richer AFTI phases in heavy-fermion systems as well as in other strong-correlated systems.

"  We report the first results of imaging the Carina Nebula with Spitzer/IRAC, providing a catalog of point sources and YSOs based on SED fits. We discuss several aspects of the extended emission, including dust pillars that result when a clumpy molecular cloud is shredded by massive star feedback. There are few ""extended green objects"" (EGOs) normally taken as signposts of outflow activity, and none of the HH jets detected optically are seen as EGOs. A population of ""extended red objects"" tends to be found around OB stars, some with clear bow-shocks. These are dusty shocks where stellar winds collide with flows off nearby clouds. Finally, the relative distributions of O stars and subclusters of YSOs as compared to dust pillars shows that while some YSOs are located within pillars, many more stars and YSOs reside just outside pillar heads. We suggest that pillars are transient phenomena, part of a continuous outwardly propagating wave of star formation driven by massive star feedback. As pillars are destroyed, they leave newly formed stars in their wake, which are then subsumed into the young OB association. Altogether, the current generation of YSOs shows no strong deviation from a normal IMF. The number of YSOs suggests a roughly constant star-formation rate over the past 3Myr, implying that star formation in pillars constitutes an important mechanism to construct unbound OB associations. Accelerated pillars may give birth to O-type stars that, after several Myr, could appear to have formed in isolation.

"  A linear mesh network is considered in which a single user per cell communicates to a local base station via a dedicated relay (two-hop communication). Exploiting the possibly relevant inter-cell channel gains, rate splitting with successive cancellation in both hops is investigated as a promising solution to improve the rate of basic single-rate communications. Then, an alternative solution is proposed that attempts to improve the performance of the second hop (from the relays to base stations) by cooperative transmission among the relay stations. The cooperative scheme leverages the common information obtained by the relays as a by-product of the use of rate splitting in the first hop. Numerical results bring insight into the conditions (network topology and power constraints) under which rate splitting, with possible relay cooperation, is beneficial. Multi-cell processing (joint decoding at the base stations) is also considered for reference.

  We study synchronized quantized charge pumping through several dynamical quantum dots (QDs) driven by a single time modulated gate signal. We show that the main obstacle for synchronization being the lack of uniformity can be overcome by operating the QDs in the decay cascade regime. We discuss the mechanism responsible for lifting the stringent uniformity requirements. This enhanced functionality of dynamical QDs might find applications in nanoelectronics and quantum metrology. ,Synchronized single electron emission from dynamical quantum dots

"  Imposing extendibility on Kasner-Fronsdal black hole local isometric embedding is equivalent to removing conic singularities in Kruskal representation. Allowing for globally non-trivial (living in $M_{5}\times S_{1}$) embeddings, parameterized by $k$, extendibility can be achieved for apparently forbidden frequencies $\omega_{1}(k)\le\omega (k)\le \omega_{2}(k)$. The Hawking-Gibbons limit, say $\displaystyle{\omega_{1,2}(0)= {1\over{4M}}}$ for Schwarzschild geometry, is respected. The corresponding Kruskal sheets are viewed as slices in some Kaluza-Klein background.

The equation has the standing wave solutions $u_\omega=e^{i\omega t}\phi_{\omega}$ with the frequency $\omega\in(-1,1)$, where $\phi_{\omega}$ obeys \begin{align*} -\Delta \phi+(1-\omega^2)\phi-\phi^p=0. \end{align*} It was proved by Shatah (1983), and Shatah, Strauss (1985) that there exists a critical frequency $\omega_c\in (0,1)$ such that the standing waves solution $u_\omega$ is orbitally stable when $\omega_c<|\omega|<1$, and orbitally unstable when $|\omega|<\omega_c$. Further, the critical case $|\omega|=\omega_c$ in the high dimension $d\ge 2$ was considered by Ohta, Todorova (2007), who proved that it is strongly unstable, by using the virial identities and the radial Sobolev inequality. The one dimension problem was left after then. In this paper, we consider the one-dimension problem and prove that it is orbitally unstable when $|\omega|=\omega_c$.

"  We define a generalization of Coxeter graphs and an associated Coxeter system and Coxeter mapping class. These can be used to construct periodic Coxeter mapping classes on surfaces with arbitrarily large genus, preserving lots of symmetries. The periodic mapping classes can in turn be used to construct sequences of pseudo-Anosov mapping classes with bounded normalized dilatation and arbitrarily high genus. We show that the smallest known accumulation point of normalized dilatations can be realized by such a sequence. ",Mapping classes associated to mixed-sign Coxeter graphs
"  Protein function and dynamics are closely related to its sequence and structure. However prediction of protein function and dynamics from its sequence and structure is still a fundamental challenge in molecular biology. Protein classification, which is typically done through measuring the similarity be- tween proteins based on protein sequence or physical information, serves as a crucial step toward the understanding of protein function and dynamics. Persistent homology is a new branch of algebraic topology that has found its success in the topological data analysis in a variety of disciplines, including molecular biology. The present work explores the potential of using persistent homology as an indepen- dent tool for protein classification. To this end, we propose a molecular topological fingerprint based support vector machine (MTF-SVM) classifier. Specifically, we construct machine learning feature vectors solely from protein topological fingerprints, which are topological invariants generated during the filtration process. To validate the present MTF-SVM approach, we consider four types of problems. First, we study protein-drug binding by using the M2 channel protein of influenza A virus. We achieve 96% accuracy in discriminating drug bound and unbound M2 channels. Additionally, we examine the use of MTF-SVM for the classification of hemoglobin molecules in their relaxed and taut forms and obtain about 80% accuracy. The identification of all alpha, all beta, and alpha-beta protein domains is carried out in our next study using 900 proteins. We have found a 85% success in this identifica- tion. Finally, we apply the present technique to 55 classification tasks of protein superfamilies over 1357 samples. An average accuracy of 82% is attained. The present study establishes computational topology as an independent and effective alternative for protein classification. ",A topological approach for protein classification
"  Quantum oxide materials possess a vast range of properties stemming from the interplay between the lattice, charge, spin and orbital degrees of freedom, in which electron correlations often play an important role. Historically, the spin-orbit coupling was rarely a dominant energy scale in oxides. It however recently came to the forefront, unleashing various exotic phenomena connected with real and reciprocal-space topology that may be harnessed in spintronics. In this article, we review the recent advances in the new field of oxide spin-orbitronics with a special focus on spin-charge interconversion from the direct and inverse spin Hall and Edelstein effects, and on the generation and observation of topological spin textures such as skyrmions. We highlight the control of spin-orbit-driven effects by ferroelectricity and give perspectives for the field. ",Oxide spin-orbitronics: spin-charge interconversion and topological spin   textures
"  We present a mock stellar catalog, matching in volume, depth and data model the content of the planned Gaia early data release 3 (Gaia EDR3). We have generated our catalog (GeDR3mock) using galaxia, a tool to sample stars from an underlying Milky Way (MW) model or from N-body data. We used an updated Besan\c{c}on Galactic model together with the latest PARSEC stellar evolutionary tracks, now also including white dwarfs. We added the Magellanic clouds and realistic open clusters with internal rotation. We empirically modelled uncertainties based on Gaia DR2 (GDR2) and scaled them according to the longer baseline in Gaia EDR3. The apparent magnitudes were reddened according to a new selection of 3D extinction maps.   To help with the Gaia selection function we provide all-sky magnitude limit maps in G and BP for a few relevant GDR2 subsets together with the routines to produce these maps for user-defined subsets. We supplement the catalog with photometry and extinctions in non-Gaia bands. The catalog is available in the Virtual Observatory and can be queried just like the actual Gaia EDR3 will be. We highlight a few capabilities of the Astronomy Data Query Language (ADQL) with educative catalog queries. We use the data extracted from those queries to compare GeDR3mock to GDR2, which emphasises the importance of adding observational noise to the mock data. Since the underlying truth, e.g. stellar parameters, is know in GeDR3mock, it can be used to construct priors as well as mock data tests for parameter estimation.   All code, models and data used to produce GeDR3mock are linked and contained in galaxia_wrap, a python package, representing a fast galactic forward model, able to project MW models and N-body data into realistic Gaia observables.

"  In solving the Schr\""odinger equation to simulate a nanoscale circuit, we note that the mean free path for electrons in some metals is as large as 48 nm. Thus, the wavefunction may propagate coherently through wires corresponding to the lines that show the potential outside of the tunneling junction. A voltage source may be modeled as a jump in the potential. Similarly, the potential across a resistor may be modeled as a sharp drop or a downward sloping line to show a decrease in the potential. Then the resistance may be determined by dividing this voltage drop by the product of the calculated current density and the effective cross-sectional area.

"  This paper deals with the early results of a new model of pedestrian flow, conceived within a measure-theoretical framework. The modeling approach consists in a discrete-time Eulerian macroscopic representation of the system via a family of measures which, pushed forward by some motion mappings, provide an estimate of the space occupancy by pedestrians at successive time steps.   From the modeling point of view, this setting is particularly suitable to treat nonlocal interactions among pedestrians, obstacles, and wall boundary conditions. In addition, analysis and numerical approximation of the resulting mathematical structures, which is the main target of this work, follow more easily and straightforwardly than in case of standard hyperbolic conservation laws, also used in the specialized literature by some Authors to address analogous problems.

"  The theoretical properties of the black holes (BHs) and of the universe were derived from a unified relativistic theory based on a generalization of local relativity for nonlocal cases in gravitational fields and a quantized standing wave particle model that accounts for relativity, quantum mechanics and the gravitational tests (See gr-qc/9509014). They fix an isentropic and conservative steady state that is independent on an eventual universe expansion because matter also expands itself in the same proportion. The new black holes BHs resulting from linear properties of the model, after capturing enough radiation, would explode. Statistically, matter would evolve, indefinitely, in rather closed cycles between gas and BH states, and vice-versa.

"  This study deals with semantic segmentation of high-resolution (aerial) images where a semantic class label is assigned to each pixel via supervised classification as a basis for automatic map generation. Recently, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown impressive performance and have quickly become the de-facto standard for semantic segmentation, with the added benefit that task-specific feature design is no longer necessary. However, a major downside of deep learning methods is that they are extremely data-hungry, thus aggravating the perennial bottleneck of supervised classification, to obtain enough annotated training data. On the other hand, it has been observed that they are rather robust against noise in the training labels. This opens up the intriguing possibility to avoid annotating huge amounts of training data, and instead train the classifier from existing legacy data or crowd-sourced maps which can exhibit high levels of noise. The question addressed in this paper is: can training with large-scale, publicly available labels replace a substantial part of the manual labeling effort and still achieve sufficient performance? Such data will inevitably contain a significant portion of errors, but in return virtually unlimited quantities of it are available in larger parts of the world. We adapt a state-of-the-art CNN architecture for semantic segmentation of buildings and roads in aerial images, and compare its performance when using different training data sets, ranging from manually labeled, pixel-accurate ground truth of the same city to automatic training data derived from OpenStreetMap data from distant locations. We report our results that indicate that satisfying performance can be obtained with significantly less manual annotation effort, by exploiting noisy large-scale training data.

"  In the late 1990's, M. Gromov introduced the notion of mean dimension for a continuous map, which is, as well as the topological entropy, an invariant under topological conjugacy. The concept of metric mean dimension for a dynamical system was introduced by Lindenstrauss and Weiss in 2000. In this paper we will verify which properties coming from the topological entropy map are valid for both mean dimension and metric mean dimension. In particular, we will prove that the metric mean dimension map is not continuous anywhere on the set consisting of continuous maps on both the Cantor set, the interval or the circle. Finally we prove that the metric mean dimension on the set consisting of continuous map on the interval and on the circle is not lower semi-continuous.

"  We present temperature dependent resistivity and ac-calorimetry measurements of CeVSb3 under pressure up to 8 GPa in a Bridgman anvil cell modified to use a liquid medium and in a diamond anvil cell using argon as a pressure medium, respectively. We observe an initial increase of the ferromagnetic transition temperature Tc with pressures up to 4.5 GPa, followed by decrease of Tc on further increase of pressure and finally its disappearance, in agreement with the Doniach model. We infer a ferromagnetic quantum critical point around 7 GPa under hydrostatic pressure conditions from the extrapolation to 0 K of Tc and the maximum of the A coefficient from low temperature fits of the resistivity \rho (T)=\rho_{0}+AT^{n}. No superconductivity under pressure was observed down to 0.35 K for this compound.

"  The quark-gluon vertex in Landau gauge is studied in the quenched approximation using the Sheikholeslami-Wohlert (SW) fermion action with mean-field improvement coefficients in the action and for the quark fields. We see that the form factor that includes the running coupling is substantially enhanced in the infrared, over and above the enhancement arising from the infrared suppression of the quark propagator alone. We define two different momentum subtraction renormalisation schemes -- \MOMT (asymmetric) and \MOMB\ (symmetric) -- and determine the running coupling in both schemes. We find Lambda_msbar(N_f=0)=300(+150/-180)(55)(30) MeV from the asymmetric scheme. This is somewhat higher than other determinations of this quantity, but the uncertainties -- both statistical and systematic -- are large. In the symmetric scheme, statistical noise prevents us from obtaining a meaningful estimate for Lambda_msbar. ",Quark-gluon vertex from lattice QCD
"  In the study of the evolution of cooperation, resource limitations are usually assumed just to provide a finite population size.

Here we study analytically a phase transition from a homogeneous population of defectors when resources are abundant to the survival of unconditional cooperators when resources reduce below a threshold. To this end, we introduce a model of simple agents, with no memory or ability of recognition, interacting in well-mixed populations.

"  The paper discusses properties of a DATALOG$^{\neg\neg}$-like query language 4QL, originally outlined in [MS10]. Negated literals in heads of rules naturally lead to inconsistencies. On the other hand, rules do not have to attach meaning to some literals. Therefore 4QL is founded on a four-valued semantics, employing the logic introduced in [MSV08, VMS09] with truth values: 'true', 'false', 'inconsistent' and 'unknown'. 4QL allows one to use rules with negation in heads and bodies of rules, it is based on a simple and intuitive semantics and provides uniform tools for ""lightweight"" versions of known forms of nonmonotonic reasoning. In addition, 4QL is tractable as regards its data complexity and captures PTIME queries. Even if DATALOG$^{\neg\neg}$ is known as a concept for the last 30 years, to our best knowledge no existing approach enjoys these properties.   In the current paper we: - investigate properties of well-supported models of 4QL - prove the correctness of the algorithm for computing well-supported models - show that 4QL has PTIME data complexity and captures PTIME.

"  Let $G$ be a graph with no isolated vertex. In this paper, we study a parameter that is a relaxation of arguably the most important domination parameter, namely the total domination number, $\gamma_t(G)$. A set $S$ of vertices in $G$ is a disjunctive total dominating set of $G$ if every vertex is adjacent to a vertex of $S$ or has at least two vertices in $S$ at distance $2$ from it. The disjunctive total domination number, $\gamma^d_t(G)$, is the minimum cardinality of such a set. We observe that $\gamma^d_t(G) \le \gamma_t(G)$.

"  The absolute neutrino masses and type of neutrino mass hierarchy are among the main problems in neutrino physics. Top-quark mass is another topical problem in particle physics.

Here I continue the search for a general flavor pattern that may incorporate these problems.

Those from 40K and 22Na could be efficiently suppressed thanks to anticoincidence operation in a crystals matrix or inside a Liquid Scintillator Veto (LSV), while that from 210Pb has been reduced by improving crystal production methods and 3H production could be reduced by shielding against cosmic rays during production. Assuming the activities of the last characterized detector, for nine crystals with a total mass of 112.5 kg the expected background rate is 2.5 counts/(keV kg d) in the region from 1 to 4 keV, which could be reduced at 1.4 counts/(keV kg d) by using a LSV.

"  (Abridged) In planetary systems with two or more giant planets, dynamical instabilities can lead to collisions or ejections through strong planet--planet scattering. Previous studies for simple initial configurations with two equal-mass planets revealed some discrepancies between the results of numerical simulations and the observed orbital elements of extrasolar planets. Here, we show that simulations with two unequal mass planets starting on nearly circular orbits predict a reduced frequency of collisions and a broader range of final eccentricities. The two-planet scattering model can easily reproduce the observed eccentricities with a plausible distribution of planet mass ratios. Further, the two-planet scattering model predicts a maximum eccentricity of about 0.8, independent of the distribution of planet mass ratios, provided that both planets are initially place on nearly circular orbits. This compares favorably with current observations and will be tested by future planet discoveries. The combination of planet--planet scattering and tidal circularization may be able to explain the existence of some giant planets with very short period orbits. Orbital migration due to planet scattering could play an important role in explaining the increased rate of giant planets with very short period orbits. We also re-examine and discuss various possible correlations between eccentricities and other properties of observed extrasolar planets. We demonstrate that the observed distribution of planet masses, orbital periods, and eccentricities can provide constraints for models of planet formation and evolution.

"  We investigate the galaxy population in a field of the Perseus cluster that roughly covers the virial radius of the cluster. The galaxies were selected on Schmidt CCD images in B and H alpha in combination with SDSS images. We present a catalogue of 1294 galaxies. Morphological information was obtained for 90% of the galaxies from the `eyeball' inspection, partly supported by the surface brightness profile analysis. Redshifts were taken from SDSS, literature sources, and own spectroscopic observations and are available for 24% of the catalogues galaxies. The galaxy catalogue is used to derive cluster properties, such as radial profiles, indications of sub-structure, virial mass, and viral radius and to study the cluster galaxy population with regard to morphological types and peculiarities, star formation rates and active galactic nuclei. In addition to the statistical approach, we present brief individual descriptions of 18 cluster galaxies with conspicuous morphological peculiarities. (Abstract modified to match the arXiv format.)

"  We provide a detailed analysis of Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universes in a wide range of scalar-tensor theories of gravity. We apply solution-generating methods to three parametrised classes of scalar-tensor theory which lead naturally to general relativity in the weak-field limit. We restrict the parameters which specify these theories by the requirements imposed by the weak-field tests of gravitation theories in the solar system and by the requirement that viable cosmological solutions be obtained. We construct a range of exact solutions for open, closed, and flat isotropic universes containing matter with equation of state $p\leq \frac{1}{3}\rho$ and in vacuum. We study the range of early and late-time behaviours displayed, examine when there is a `bounce' at early times, and expansion maxima in closed models.

We study the differential decay rates and the di-lepton forward-backward, lepton polarization and various CP asymmetries with a new simple set of form factors inspired by the heavy quark effective theory. We show that most of the observables are insensitive to the non-perturbative QCD effects. To illustrate the effect of new physics, we discuss our results in an explicit supersymmetric extension of the standard model, which contains new CP violating phases and therefore induces sizable CP violating asymmetries.

The solution is obtained anew by the alternative Hamiltonian formalism. For $r\rightarrow \infty $ it asymptotes to the charged BTZ black hole. It is shown that by inserting a charged, thin-shell (or ring) the charge of the regular black hole can be screened from the external world.

"  hree limited samples of high-redshift radio sources of FRII-type are used to constrain the dynamical model for the jets' propagation through the two-media environment: the X-ray emitting halo with the power-law density profile surrounding the parent galaxy and the much hotter intergalactic medium (IGM) of a constant density. The model originally developed by Gopal-Krishna & Wiita (1987) is modified adopting modern values of its free parameters taken from recent X-ray measurements with the XMM-Newton and Chandra Observatories. We find that (i) giant-sized radio sources ($\sim$1 Mpc) exist at redshifts up to $z\sim 2$, (ii) all newly identified the largest radio sources with $1<z<2$ appeared to be quasars, (iii) all of them are younger and expanding faster than their counterparts at lower redshifts, and (iv) the above properties are rather due to the powerful jets than peculiar environmental conditions (e.g. voids) in the IGM. The extreme powerful jets may testify to a dominant role of the accretion processes onto black holes in earlier cosmological epochs.

"  Let S be a commutative semiring. M. Droste and P. Gastin have introduced in 2005 weighted monadic second order logic WMSOL with weights in S. They use a syntactic fragment RMSOL of WMSOL to characterize word functions (power series) recognizable by weighted automata, where the semantics of quantifiers is used both as arithmetical operations and, in the boolean case, as quantification.   Already in 2001, B. Courcelle, J.Makowsky and U. Rotics have introduced a formalism for graph parameters definable in Monadic Second order Logic, here called MSOLEVAL with values in a ring R. Their framework can be easily adapted to semirings S. This formalism clearly separates the logical part from the arithmetical part and also applies to word functions.   In this paper we give two proofs that RMSOL and MSOLEVAL with values in S have the same expressive power over words. One proof shows directly that MSOLEVAL captures the functions recognizable by weighted automata. The other proof shows how to translate the formalisms from one into the other.

"  There have been of late renewed debates on the role of inhomogeneities to explain the observed late acceleration of the universe. We have looked into the problem analytically with the help of the well known spherically symmetric but inhomogeneous Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi(LTB) model generalised to higher dimensions. It is observed that in contrast to the claim made by Kolb et al the presence of inhomogeneities as well as extra dimensions can not reverse the signature of the deceleration parameter if the matter field obeys the energy conditions. The well known Raychaudhuri equation also points to the same result. Without solving the field equations explicitly it can, however, be shown that although the total deceleration is positive everywhere nevertheless it does not exclude the possibility of having radial acceleration, even in the pure dust universe, if the angular scale factor is decelerating fast enough and vice versa. Moreover it is found that introduction of extra dimensions can not reverse the scenario. To the contrary it actually helps the decelerating process.

"  In this work, a rationalized algorithm for calculating the quotient of two quaternions is presented which reduces the number of underlying real multiplications. Hardware for fast multiplication is much more expensive than hardware for fast addition. Therefore, reducing the number of multiplications in VLSI processor design is usually a desirable task. The performing of a quaternion division using the naive method takes 16 multiplications, 15 additions, 4 squarings and 4 divisions of real numbers while the proposed algorithm can compute the same result in only 8 multiplications (or multipliers in hardware implementation case), 31 additions, 4 squaring and 4 division of real numbers.

"  How to represent a face pattern? While it is presented in a continuous way in our visual system, computers often store and process the face image in a discrete manner with 2D arrays of pixels. In this study, we attempt to learn a continuous representation for face images with explicit functions. First, we propose an explicit model (EmFace) for human face representation in the form of a finite sum of mathematical terms, where each term is an analytic function element. Further, to estimate the unknown parameters of EmFace, a novel neural network, EmNet, is designed with an encoder-decoder structure and trained using the backpropagation algorithm, where the encoder is defined by a deep convolutional neural network and the decoder is an explicit mathematical expression of EmFace. Experimental results show that EmFace has a higher representation performance on faces with various expressions, postures, and other factors, compared to that of other methods. Furthermore, EmFace achieves reasonable performance on several face image processing tasks, including face image restoration, denoising, and transformation.

"  Strong lensing of gravitational waves is more likely for distant sources but predicted event rates are highly uncertain with many astrophysical origins proposed. Here we open a new avenue to estimate the event rate of strongly lensed systems by exploring the amplitude of the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). This method can provide a direct upper bound on the high redshift binary coalescing rates, which can be translated into an upper bound on the expected rate of strongly lensed systems. We show that from the ongoing analysis of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO)-Virgo and in the future from the LIGO-Virgo design sensitivity stringent bounds on the lensing event rate can be imposed using the SGWB signal. Combining measurements of loud gravitational wave events with an unresolved stochastic background detection will improve estimates of the numbers of lensed events at high redshift. The proposed method is going to play a crucial in understanding the population of lensed and unlensed systems from gravitational wave observations.

"  This paper addresses the path selection problem from a known source to the destination in dense networks. The proposed solution for route discovery uses the genetic algorithm approach for a QoS based network. The multi point crossover and mutation helps in determining the optimal path and alternate path when required. The input to the genetic algorithm is a learnt module which is a part of the cognitive router that takes care of four QoS parameters. Here the set of nodes selected for routing is determined by delay, jitter and loss. On this graded surface of nodes selected, the bandwidth parameter is considered for path selection. The aim of the approach is to occupy the maximized bandwidth along the forward channels and minimize the route length. The population size is considered as fixed nodes participating in the network scenario, which will be limited to a known size of topology. The simulated results show that by using genetic algorithm (GA) approach the probability of convergence to shortest path is higher.

"  In a perfect world, all articles consistently contain sufficient metadata to describe the resource. We know this is not the reality, so we are motivated to investigate the evolution of the metadata that is present when authors and publishers supply their own. Because applying metadata takes time, we recognize that each news article author has a limited metadata budget with which to spend their time and effort. How are they spending this budget? What are the top metadata categories in use? How did they grow over time? What purpose do they serve? We also recognize that not all metadata fields are used equally. What is the growth of individual fields over time? Which fields experienced the fastest adoption? In this paper, we review 227,726 HTML news articles from 29 outlets captured by the Internet Archive between 1998 and 2016. Upon reviewing the metadata fields in each article, we discovered that 2010 began a metadata renaissance as publishers embraced metadata for improved search engine ranking, search engine tracking, social media tracking, and social media sharing. When analyzing individual fields, we find that one application of metadata stands out above all others: social cards -- the cards generated by platforms like Twitter when one shares a URL. Once a metadata standard was established for cards in 2010, its fields were adopted by 20% of articles in the first year and reached more than 95% adoption by 2016. This rate of adoption surpasses efforts like Schema.org and Dublin Core by a fair margin. When confronted with these results on how news publishers spend their metadata budget, we must conclude that it is all about the cards.

"  With the continuing development of affordable immersive virtual reality (VR) systems, there is now a growing market for consumer content. The current form of consumer systems is not dissimilar to the lab-based VR systems of the past 30 years: the primary input mechanism is a head-tracked display and one or two tracked hands with buttons and joysticks on hand-held controllers. Over those 30 years, a very diverse academic literature has emerged that covers design and ergonomics of 3D user interfaces (3DUIs). However, the growing consumer market has engaged a very broad range of creatives that have built a very diverse set of designs. Sometimes these designs adopt findings from the academic literature, but other times they experiment with completely novel or counter-intuitive mechanisms. In this paper and its online adjunct, we report on novel 3DUI design patterns that are interesting from both design and research perspectives: they are highly novel, potentially broadly re-usable and/or suggest interesting avenues for evaluation. The supplemental material, which is a living document, is a crowd-sourced repository of interesting patterns. This paper is a curated snapshot of those patterns that were considered to be the most fruitful for further elaboration. ",Directions for 3D User Interface Research from Consumer VR Games
"  While the notion of age of information (AoI) has recently been proposed for analyzing ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC), most of the existing works have focused on the average AoI measure. Designing a wireless network based on average AoI will fail to characterize the performance of URLLC systems, as it cannot account for extreme AoI events, occurring with very low probabilities. In contrast, this paper goes beyond the average AoI to improve URLLC in a vehicular communication network by characterizing and controlling the AoI tail distribution. In particular, the transmission power minimization problem is studied under stringent URLLC constraints in terms of probabilistic AoI for both deterministic and Markovian traffic arrivals. Accordingly, an efficient novel mapping between AoI and queue-related distributions is proposed. Subsequently, extreme value theory (EVT) and Lyapunov optimization techniques are adopted to formulate and solve the problem considering both long and short packets transmissions. Simulation results show over a two-fold improvement, in shortening the AoI distribution tail, versus a baseline that models the maximum queue length distribution, in addition to a tradeoff between arrival rate and AoI.

"  In current Data Center Networks (DCNs), Equal- Cost MultiPath (ECMP) is used as the de-facto routing protocol. However, ECMP does not differentiate between short and long flows, the two main categories of flows depending on their duration (lifetime). This issue causes hot-spots in the network, affecting negatively the Flow Completion Time (FCT) and the throughput, the two key performance metrics in data center networks. Previous work on load balancing proposed solutions such as splitting long flows into short flows, using per-packet forwarding approaches, and isolating the paths of short and long flows. We propose DiffFlow, a new load balancing solution which detects long flows and forwards packets using Random Packet Spraying (RPS) with help of SDN, whereas the flows with small duration are forwarded with ECMP by default. The use of ECMP for short flows is reasonable, as it does not create the out-of-order problem; at the same time, RPS for long flows can efficiently help to load balancing the entire network, given that long flows represent most of the traffic in DCNs. The results show that our DiffFlow solution outperforms both the individual usage of either RPS or ECMP, while the overall throughput achieved is maintained at the level comparable to RPS.

"  This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to a crucial sign error in equation 1. With the advance of online social networks, there has been extensive research on how to spread influence in online social networks, and many algorithms and models have been proposed. However, many fundamental problems have also been overlooked. Among those, the most important problems are the incentive aspect and the privacy aspect (eg, nodes' relationships) of the influence propagation in online social networks. Bearing these defects in mind, and incorporating the powerful tool from differential privacy, we propose PRINCE, which is a series of \underline{PR}ivacy preserving mechanisms for \underline{IN}fluen\underline{CE} diffusion in online social networks to solve the problems. We not only theoretically prove many elegant properties of PRINCE, but also implement PRINCE to evaluate its performance extensively. The evaluation results show that PRINCE achieves good performances. To the best of our knowledge, PRINCE is the first differentially private mechanism for influence diffusion in online social networks.

"  Secondary structure formation of nucleic acids strongly depends on salt concentration and temperature. We develop a theory for RNA folding that correctly accounts for sequence effects, the entropic contributions associated with loop formation, and salt effects. Using an iterative expression for the partition function that neglects pseudoknots, we calculate folding free energies and minimum free energy configurations based on the experimentally derived base pairing free energies. The configurational entropy of loop formation is modeled by the asymptotic expression -c ln m, where m is the length of the loop and c the loop exponent, which is an adjustable constant. Salt effects enter in two ways: first, we derive salt induced modifications of the free energy parameters for describing base pairing and, second, we include the electrostatic free energy for loop formation. Both effects are modeled on the Debye-Hueckel level including counterion condensation. We validate our theory for two different RNA sequences: For tRNA-phe, the resultant heat capacity curves for thermal denaturation at various salt concentrations accurately reproduce experimental results. For the P5ab RNA hairpin, we derive the global phase diagram in the three-dimensional space spanned by temperature, stretching force, and salt concentration and obtain good agreement with the experimentally determined critical unfolding force. We show that for a proper description of RNA melting and stretching, both salt and loop entropy effects are needed. ","Theory for RNA folding, stretching, and melting including loops and salt"

"  Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic (A3C) is an effective Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm for a wide range of tasks, such as Atari games and robot control. The agent learns policies and value function through trial-and-error interactions with the environment until converging to an optimal policy. Robustness and stability are critical in RL; however, neural network can be vulnerable to noise from unexpected sources and is not likely to withstand very slight disturbances. We note that agents generated from mild environment using A3C are not able to handle challenging environments. Learning from adversarial examples, we proposed an algorithm called Adversary Robust A3C (AR-A3C) to improve the agent's performance under noisy environments. In this algorithm, an adversarial agent is introduced to the learning process to make it more robust against adversarial disturbances, thereby making it more adaptive to noisy environments. Both simulations and real-world experiments are carried out to illustrate the stability of the proposed algorithm. The AR-A3C algorithm outperforms A3C in both clean and noisy environments.

"  We demonstrate a novel method for the excitation of sizable magneto-optical effects in Au by means of the laser-induced injection of hot spin-polarized electrons in Au/Fe/MgO(001) heterostructures. It is based on the energy- and spin-dependent electron transmittance of Fe/Au interface which acts as a spin filter for non-thermalized electrons optically excited in Fe. We show that after crossing the interface, majority electrons propagate through the Au layer with the velocity on the order of 1 nm/fs (close to the Fermi velocity) and the decay length on the order of 100 nm. Featuring ultrafast functionality and requiring no strong external magnetic fields, spin injection results in a distinct magneto-optical response of Au. We develop a formalism based on the phase of the transient complex MOKE response and demonstrate its robustness in a plethora of experimental and theoretical MOKE studies on Au, including our ab initio calculations.

"  In the standard thin disc formalism the dimensionless $\alpha$ parameter is usually assumed to be constant. However, there are good theoretical reasons for believing, as well as evidence from simulations, that $\alpha$ is dependent on intrinsic disc properties. In this paper we analyse the conditions for the stability of a thin accretion disc in which $\alpha$ is a function of the magnetic Prandtl number, the ratio of collisional viscosity to resistivity. In the inner disc, where the free electron opacity and radiation viscosity dominate, the disc is unstable if $\alpha$ is proportional to the magnetic Prandtl number with an exponent, $n$, and $6/13<n<10/3$. This is within the range of values for the power-law index found in MHD simulations with simple energetics. We calculate the evolution of the unstable disc within the $\alpha$ formalism and show that the physically accessible solutions form a limit cycle, analogous to the behaviour seen in recurrent dwarf novae. It is noteworthy that the time-dependent global behaviour of the instability results in cyclic heating of the inner section of the disc, when parameters appropriate for an X-ray binary system are used. We calculate a model spectrum of the disc in the flaring and quiescent states and show that the behaviour is compatible with X-ray observations of the thermal accretion disc in flaring X-ray binary systems.

"  We optimize a collision-induced cooling process for ultracold atoms in the nondegenerate regime. It makes use of a Feshbach resonance, instead of rf radiation in evaporative cooling, to selectively expel hot atoms from a trap. Using functional minimization we analytically show that for the optimal cooling process the resonance energy must be tuned such that it linearly follows the temperature. Here, optimal cooling is defined as maximizing the phase-space density after a fixed cooling duration. The analytical results are confirmed by numerical Monte-Carlo simulations. In order to simulate more realistic experimental conditions, we show that background losses do not change our conclusions, while additional non-resonant two-body losses make a lower initial resonance energy with non-linear dependence on temperature preferable.

"  This paper introduces a novel boundary integral approach of shape uncertainty quantification for the Helmholtz scattering problem in the framework of the so-called parametric method. The key idea is to construct an integration grid whose associated weight function encompasses the irregularities and nonsmoothness imposed by the random boundary. Thus, the solution can be evaluated accurately with relatively low number of grid points. The integration grid is obtained by employing a low-dimensional spatial embedding using the coarea formula. The proposed method can handle large variation as well as non-smoothness of the random boundary. For the ease of presentation the theory is restricted to star-shaped obstacles in low-dimensional setting. Higher spatial and parametric dimensional cases are discussed, though, not extensively explored in the current study.

  The nodal lines of random wave functions are investigated.

It is also shown that using the dipolar variant of SLE reduces significantly finite size effects. ,SLE description of the nodal lines of random wave functions
"  We investigate a two-way cascaded cavity QED system consisting of microtoroidal resonators coupled through an optical fiber. Each microtoroidal cavity supports two counter-propagating whispering-gallery modes coupled to single atoms through their evanescent fields. We focus on a pair of atom-microtoroid systems and compute the spectrum of spontaneous emission into the fiber with one atom initially excited. Explicit results are presented for strong-coupling and bad-cavity regimes, where the latter allows the effective atom-atom interaction to be controlled through the atom-cavity coupling and detuning: the atoms exhibit either collective spontaneous emission with no dipole-dipole interaction or a (coherent) dipole-dipole interaction and independent (single-atom) emission. This capacity for switching the character of the interaction is a feature of bi-directional coupling and connects our two-way cascaded system to work on one-dimensional waveguides. Building upon our bad-cavity results, we generalize to many atom-microtoroid systems coupled through an optical fiber.

First we show that given a Meyer set and any intensity a less than the maximum intensity of its Bragg peaks, the set of Bragg peaks whose intensity exceeds a is itself a Meyer set (in the Fourier space). Second we show that if a Meyer set is modified by addition and removal of points in such a way that its density is not altered too much (the allowable amount being given explicitly as a proportion of the original density) then the newly obtained set still has a relatively dense set of Bragg peaks.

"  Helicity, as one of only two inviscid invariants in three-dimensional turbulence, plays an important role in the generation and evolution of turbulence. From the traditional viewpoint, there exists only one channel of helicity cascade similar to that of kinetic energy cascade. Through theoretical analysis, we find that there are two channels in helicity cascade process. The first channel mainly originates from vortex twisting process, and the second channel mainly originates from vortex stretching process. By analysing the data of direct numerical simulations of typical turbulent flows, we find that these two channels behave differently. The ensemble averages of helicity flux in different channels are equal in homogeneous and isotropic turbulence, while they are different in other type of turbulent flows. The second channel is more intermittent and acts more like a scalar, especially on small scales. Besides, we find a novel mechanism of hindered even inverse energy cascade, which could be attributed to the second-channel helicity flux with large amplitude.

"  The number of classes of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), besides the well-established short and long ones, remains a debatable issue. It was already shown, however, that when invoking skewed distributions, the $\log T_{90}$ and $\log T_{90} - \log H_{32}$ spaces are adequately modeled with mixtures of only two such components, implying two GRB types. Herein, a comprehensive multivariate analysis of several multi-dimensional parameter spaces is conducted for the BATSE sample of GRBs, with the usage of skewed distributions. It is found that the number of extracted components varies between the examined parameter sets, and ranges from 2 to 4, with higher-dimensional spaces allowing for more classes. A Monte Carlo testing implies that these additional components are likely to be artifacts owing to the finiteness of the data and be a result of examining a particular realization of the data as a random sample, resulting in spurious identifications.

"  The recent discovery of a Higgs boson at the LHC, while establishing the Higgs mechanism as the way of electroweak symmetry breaking, started an era of precision measurements involving the Higgs boson. In an effective Lagrangian framework, we consider the $e^+e^-\rightarrow ZHH$ process at the ILC running at a centre of mass energy of 500 GeV to investigate the effect of the $ZZH$ and $ZZHH$ couplings on the sensitivity of $HHH$ coupling in this process. Our results show that the sensitivity of the trilinear Higgs self couplings on this process has somewhat strong dependence on the Higgs-gauge boson couplings. Single and two parameter reach of the ILC with an integrated luminosity of 1000 fb$^{-1}$ are obtained on all the effective couplings indicating how these limits are affected by the presence of anomalous $ZZH$ and $ZZHH$ couplings. The kinematic distributions studied to understand the effect of the anomalous couplings, again, show a strong influence of $Z$-$H$ couplings on the dependence of these distributions on $HHH$ coupling. Similar results are indicated in the case of the process, $e^+e^-\rightarrow \nu\bar \nu HH$, considered at a centre of mass energy of 2 TeV, where the cross section is large enough. The effect of $WWH$ and $WWHH$ couplings on the sensitivity of $HHH$ coupling is clearly established through our analyses in this process.

"  In the present paper we study a sparse stochastic network enabled with a block structure. The popular Stochastic Block Model (SBM) and the Degree Corrected Block Model (DCBM) address sparsity by placing an upper bound on the maximum probability of connections between any pair of nodes. As a result, sparsity describes only the behavior of network as a whole, without distinguishing between the block-dependent sparsity patterns. To the best of our knowledge, the recently introduced Popularity Adjusted Block Model (PABM) is the only block model that allows to introduce a {\it structural sparsity} where some probabilities of connections are identically equal to zero while the rest of them remain above a certain threshold. The latter presents a more nuanced view of the network. ",Sparse Popularity Adjusted Stochastic Block Model
"  Disjointly constrained multilinear programming concerns the problem of maximizing a multilinear function on the product of finitely many disjoint polyhedra. While maximizing a linear function on a polytope (linear programming) is known to be solvable in polynomial time, even bilinear programming is NP-hard. Based on a reformulation of the problem in terms of sum-of-squares polynomials, we study a hierarchy of semidefinite relaxations to the problem. It follows from the general theory that the sequence of optimal values converges asymptotically to the optimal value of the multilinear program. We show that the semidefinite hierarchy converges generically in finitely many steps to the optimal value of the multilinear problem. We outline two applications of the main result. For nondegenerate bimatrix games, a Nash equilibrium can be computed by the sum of squares approach in finitely many steps. Under an additional geometric condition, the NP-complete containment problem for projections of $\mathcal{H}$-polytopes can be decided in finitely many steps.

"  Three-dimensional (3D) compensated MnBi2Te4 is antiferromagnetic, but undergoes a spin-flop transition at intermediate fields, resulting in a canted phase before saturation. In this work, we experimentally show that the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in MnBi2Te4 originates from a topological response that is sensitive to the perpendicular magnetic moment and to its canting angle. Synthesis by molecular beam epitaxy allows us to obtain a large-area quasi-3D 24-layer MnBi2Te4 with near-perfect compensation that hosts the phase diagram observed in bulk which we utilize to probe the AHE. This AHE is seen to exhibit an antiferromagnetic response at low magnetic fields, and a clear evolution at intermediate fields through surface and bulk spin-flop transitions into saturation. Throughout this evolution, the AHE is super-linear versus magnetization rather than the expected linear relationship. We reveal that this discrepancy is related to the canting angle, consistent with the symmetry of the crystal. Our findings suggests that novel topological responses may be found in non-collinear ferromagnetic, and antiferromagnetic phases.

"  A system reconfiguration problem is considered for three-phase power distribution networks featuring distributed generation. In lieu of binary line selection variables, the notion of group sparsity is advocated to re-formulate the nonconvex distribution system reconfiguration (DSR) problem into a convex one. Using the duality theory, it is shown that the line selection task boils down to a shrinkage and thresholding operation on the line currents. Further, numerical tests illustrate the ability of the proposed scheme to identify meshed, weakly-meshed, or even radial configurations by adjusting a sparsity-tuning parameter in the DSR cost. Constraints on the voltages are investigated, and incorporated in the novel DSR problem to effect voltage regulation. ",Sparsity-leveraging Reconfiguration of Smart Distribution Systems
"  A monitoring programme of CSS 121005:212625+201948 covering nearly two observing seasons has shown that it is a typical SU UMa dwarf nova, but it has one of the shortest supercycles of its class, at 66.9(6) d. The superoutbursts are interspersed with 3 to 7 short duration (~2 days) normal outbursts each of which are separated by a mean interval of 11 days, but can be as short as 2 days. The most intensively studied superoutburst was that of 2014 November, which lasted 14 days and had an outburst amplitude of >4.8 magnitudes, reaching magnitude 15.7 at its brightest. Time resolved photometry revealed superhumps with a peak-to-peak amplitude of 0.2 magnitudes, later declining to 0.1 magnitude. The superhump period was Psh = 0.08838(18) d.

"  The recent interest in modified theories of gravity, involving some type of non-minimal coupling to the Ricci scalar, and the calculation of cosmological observables in the Einstein or the Jordan frame, motivate the formulation of these theories in terms of quantities that are invariant under frame transformations. Furthermore, in view of the description of gravity and its geometry motivated by string theory, such a formulation could be extended to include theories of extra spatial dimensions. In the present article, we generalize the construction of frame-invariant quantities, concerning a general, $D$-dimensional scalar-tensor theory. Then, we limit our scope to the 5D braneworld scenario, where we study thick brane solutions that are localized on the 3-brane and extend the invariant formulation to the case of multiple scalar fields (non-)minimally coupled to gravity.

"  The infinitesimal space of a quasiregular mapping was introduced by Gutlyanskii et al and generalized the idea of a derivative for this class of mappings which is only differentiable almost everywhere. In this paper, we show that the infinitesimal space is either simple, that is, it consists of only one mapping, or it contains uncountable many. To achieve this, we define the orbit of a given point as its image under all elements of the infinitesimal space. We prove that this orbit is a compact and connected subset of $\mathbb{R}^n \setminus \{ 0 \}$ and moreover, every such set in dimension two can be realized as an orbit space. We conclude with some examples exhibiting features of orbits. ",The Orbits of Generalized Derivatives
"  We describe the behavior of a repulsively interacting Bose-Einstein condensate of indirect dipolar exciton gas in a double quantum well (QW) system under external static or dynamic electric fields at finite temperatures. Electrostatic perturbation is considered to be created by an impurity atom or shot-range defect of QW fluctuation. The screening of this defect potential by an exciton condensate is studied. We find asymptotic spatial dependence of the screened potential and analyse its dependence on the temperature and exciton concentration. It is shown that the asymptotic of the screened potential has a steep power law dependence in contrast to the well known results of electron gas. This peculiarity reflects the bosonic nature of the exciton condensate. The behavior of exciton condensate under external alternative field created by a surface acoustic wave (SAW) is examined in detail. We focus our attention on the dependence of SAW absorption coefficient on temperature and exciton concentration. We found that at zero temperatures Landau damping does not contribute to the SAW absorption, but the Belyaev mechanism produces unusual behavior of SAW absorption coefficient on exciton concentration: if the exciton concentration exceeds some critical value, the SAW absorption vanishes. At finite temperatures Landau damping comes into action and results in washing out the sharp absorption behavior. Such unusual SAW absorption properties can be used for experimental evidence of the exciton condensation. This method is also applicable to the experimental testing of both dark and bright exciton condensates, that is impossible to do with the optical luminescence technique.

As a consequence, we prove the validity of the strong maximum principle for uniformly elliptic operators of any even order, in fairly general domains in dimension two and three, provided second order derivatives are taken into account.

"  The task of building footprint segmentation has been well-studied in the context of remote sensing (RS) as it provides valuable information in many aspects, however, difficulties brought by the nature of RS images such as variations in the spatial arrangements and in-consistent constructional patterns require studying further, since it often causes poorly classified segmentation maps. We address this need by designing a joint optimization scheme for the task of building footprint delineation and introducing two auxiliary tasks; image reconstruction and building footprint boundary segmentation with the intent to reveal the common underlying structure to advance the classification accuracy of a single task model under the favor of auxiliary tasks. In particular, we propose a deep multi-task learning (MTL) based unified fully convolutional framework which operates in an end-to-end manner by making use of joint loss function with learnable loss weights considering the homoscedastic uncertainty of each task loss. Experimental results conducted on the SpaceNet6 dataset demonstrate the potential of the proposed MTL framework as it improves the classification accuracy considerably compared to single-task and lesser compounded tasks.

"  Language-integrated query based on comprehension syntax is a powerful technique for safe database programming, and provides a basis for advanced techniques such as query shredding or query flattening that allow efficient programming with complex nested collections. However, the foundations of these techniques are lacking: although SQL, the most widely-used database query language, supports heterogeneous queries that mix set and multiset semantics, these important capabilities are not supported by known correctness results or implementations that assume homogeneous collections. In this paper we study language-integrated query for a heterogeneous query language $NRC_\lambda(Set,Bag)$ that combines set and multiset constructs. We show how to normalize and translate queries to SQL, and develop a novel approach to querying heterogeneous nested collections, based on the insight that ``local'' query subexpressions that calculate nested subcollections can be ``lifted'' to the top level analogously to lambda-lifting for local function definitions.

"  Study of primary stars lying in Sirius-like systems with various masses of WD companions and orbital separations is one of the key aspects to understand the origin and nature of Barium (Ba) stars. In this paper, based on high resolution and high S/N spectra, we present systematic analysis of photospheric abundances for 18 FGK primary stars of Sirius-like systems including six giants and 12 dwarfs. Atmospheric parameters, stellar masses, and abundances of 24 elements (C, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, K, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, La, Ce and Nd) are determined homogeneously. The abundance patterns in these sample stars show that most of the elements in our sample follow the behavior of field stars with similar metallicity. As expected, s-process elements in four known Ba giants show overabundance. A weak correlation was found between anomalies of s-process elemental abundance and orbital separation, suggesting the orbital separation of the binaries could not be the main constraint to differentiate strong Ba stars from mild Ba stars. Our study shows that the large mass (>0.51 M ) of a WD companion in a binary system is not a sufficient condition to form a Ba star, even if the separation between the two components is small. Although not sufficient it seems to be a necessary condition since Ba stars with lower mass WDs in the observed sample were not found. Our results support that [s/Fe] and [hs/ls] ratios of Ba stars are anti-correlated with the metallicity. However, the different levels of s-process overabundance among Ba stars may not to be dominated mainly by the metallicity. ",Chemical abundances of primary stars in the Sirius-like binary systems
"  Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) is important for understanding the composition of the present-day interstellar medium (ISM) and of our solar system. In this paper, we aim to track the GCE by using the 29Si/30Si ratios in evolved stars and tentatively relate this to presolar grain composition. We used the APEX telescope to detect thermal SiO isotopologue emission toward four oxygen-rich M-type stars. Together with the data retrieved from the Herschel science archive and from the literature, we were able to obtain the 29Si/30Si ratios for a total of 15 evolved stars inferred from their optically thin 29SiO and 30SiO emission. These stars cover a range of masses and ages, and because they do not significantly alter 29Si/30Si during their lifetimes, they provide excellent probes of the ISM metallicity (or 29Si/30Si ratio) as a function of time. The 29Si/30Si ratios inferred from the thermal SiO emission tend to be lower toward low-mass oxygen-rich stars (e.g., down to about unity for W Hya), and close to an interstellar or solar value of 1.5 for the higher-mass carbon star IRC+10216 and two red supergiants. There is a tentative correlation between the 29Si/30Si ratios and the mass-loss rates of evolved stars, where we take the mass-loss rate as a proxy for the initial stellar mass or current stellar age. This is consistent with the different abundance ratios found in presolar grains. We found that older objects (up to possibly 10 Gyr old) in our sample trace a previous, lower 29Si/30Si value of about 1. Material with this isotopic ratio is present in two subclasses of presolar grains, providing independent evidence of the lower ratio. Therefore, the 29Si/30Si ratio derived from the SiO emission of evolved stars is a useful diagnostic tool for the study of the GCE and presolar grains.

"  We find that single spin asymmetries in NRQCD are non-vanishing in general. They are proportional to the imaginary parts of some non-perturbative matrix elements. With statistics of about 10^6 identified J/psi's, or 10^5 identified chi_2, it is possible to measure these imaginary parts even if they are an order of magnitude smaller than the real parts. Such statistics are quite reasonable at polarised HERA N and other future experiments. ",Single Polarisation Asymmetries for Quarkonia in Non-relativistic QCD
"  We discuss the ground-breaking science that will be possible with a wide area survey, using the MeerKAT telescope, known as MeerKLASS (MeerKAT Large Area Synoptic Survey). The current specifications of MeerKAT make it a great fit for science applications that require large survey speeds but not necessarily high angular resolutions. In particular, for cosmology, a large survey over $\sim 4,000 \, {\rm deg}^2$ for $\sim 4,000$ hours will potentially provide the first ever measurements of the baryon acoustic oscillations using the 21cm intensity mapping technique, with enough accuracy to impose constraints on the nature of dark energy. The combination with multi-wavelength data will give unique additional information, such as exquisite constraints on primordial non-Gaussianity using the multi-tracer technique, as well as a better handle on foregrounds and systematics. Such a wide survey with MeerKAT is also a great match for HI galaxy studies, providing unrivalled statistics in the pre-SKA era for galaxies resolved in the HI emission line beyond local structures at z > 0.01. It will also produce a large continuum galaxy sample down to a depth of about 5\,$\mu$Jy in L-band, which is quite unique over such large areas and will allow studies of the large-scale structure of the Universe out to high redshifts, complementing the galaxy HI survey to form a transformational multi-wavelength approach to study galaxy dynamics and evolution. Finally, the same survey will supply unique information for a range of other science applications, including a large statistical investigation of galaxy clusters as well as produce a rotation measure map across a huge swathe of the sky. The MeerKLASS survey will be a crucial step on the road to using SKA1-MID for cosmological applications and other commensal surveys, as described in the top priority SKA key science projects (abridged).

We discuss how systematic errors affect the evidence for an infrared fixed point (IRFP). We present the first measurement of the running of the mass in the SF scheme. The anomalous dimension of the chiral condensate, which is relevant for phenomenological applications, can be easily extracted from the running of the mass, under the assumption that the theory has an IRFP.

"  The near future mm/sub-mm VLBI experiments are ambitious projects aiming at imaging the ""shadow"" of the supermassive black hole candidate at the center of the Milky Way and of the ones in nearby galaxies. An accurate observation of the shape of the shadow can potentially test the nature of these objects and verify if they are Kerr black holes, as predicted by general relativity. However, previous work on the subject has shown that the shadows produced in other spacetimes are very similar to the one of the Kerr background, suggesting that tests of strong gravity are not really possible with these facilities in the near future. In this work, I instead point out that it will be relatively easy to distinguish black holes from wormholes, topologically non-trivial structures of the spacetime that might have been formed in the early Universe and might connect our Universe with other universes.

"  A diversity of animals that run on solid, level, flat, non-slip surfaces appear to bounce on their legs; elastic elements in the limbs can store and return energy during each step. The mechanics and energetics of running in natural terrain, particularly on surfaces that can yield and flow under stress, is less understood. The zebra-tailed lizard (Callisaurus draconoides), a small desert generalist with a large, elongate, tendinous hind foot, runs rapidly across a variety of natural substrates. We use high speed video to obtain detailed three-dimensional running kinematics on solid and granular surfaces to reveal how leg, foot, and substrate mechanics contribute to its high locomotor performance. Running at ~10 body length/s (~1 m/s), the center of mass oscillates like a spring-mass system on both substrates, with only 15% reduction in stride length on the granular surface. On the solid surface, a strut-spring model of the hind limb reveals that the hind foot saves about 40% of the mechanical work needed per step, significant for the lizard's small size. On the granular surface, a penetration force model and hypothesized subsurface foot rotation indicates that the hind foot paddles through fluidized granular medium, and that the energy lost per step during irreversible deformation of the substrate does not differ from the reduction in the mechanical energy of the center of mass. The upper hind leg muscles must perform three times as much mechanical work on the granular surface as on the solid surface to compensate for the greater energy lost within the foot and to the substrate.

"  We extend the impulse theory for unsteady aerodynamics, from its classic global form to finite-domain formulation then to minimum-domain form, and from incompressible to compressible flows. For incompressible flow, the minimum-domain impulse theory raises the finding of Li and Lu (J. Fluid Mech., 712: 598-613, 2012) to a theorem: The entire force with discrete wake is completely determined by only the time rate of impulse of those vortical structures still connecting to the body, along with the Lamb-vector integral thereof that captures the contribution of all the rest disconnected vortical structures. For compressible flow, we find that the global form in terms of the curl of momentum, obtained by Huang (Unsteady Vortical Aerodynamics. Shanghai Jiaotong Univ. Press, 1994), can be generalized to having arbitrary finite domain, but the formula is cumbersome and in general the curl of momentum no longer has discrete structure and hence no minimum-domain theory exists. Nevertheless, as the measure of transverse process only, the unsteady field of vorticity may still have discrete wake. This leads to a minimum-domain compressible vorticity-moment theory in terms of density-weighted vorticity (but it is beyond the classic concept of impulse). These new findings and applications have been confirmed by our numerical experiments. The results not only open an avenue to combine the theory with computation-experiment in wide applications, but also reveals a physical truth that it is no longer necessary to account for all wake vortical structures in computing the force and moment.

"  We study wavefunctions of heavy scalars on de Sitter spacetime and their implications to dS/CFT correspondence. In contrast to light fields in the complementary series, heavy fields in the principal series oscillate outside the cosmological horizon. As a consequence, the quadratic term in the wavefunction does not follow a simple scaling and so it is hard to identify it with a conformal two-point function. In this paper, we demonstrate that it should be interpreted as a two-point function on a cyclic RG flow which is obtained by double-trace deformations of the dual CFT. This is analogous to the situation in nonrelativistic AdS/CFT with a bulk scalar whose mass squared is below the Breitenlohner-Freedman (BF) bound. We also provide a new dS/CFT dictionary relating de Sitter two-point functions and conformal two-point functions in the would-be dual CFT.

"  We propose a methodology for computing single and multi-asset European option prices, and more generally expectations of scalar functions of (multivariate) random variables.

The method is based on the principle ""approximate and integrate"" in three steps i) sample the integrand at points in the integration domain, ii) approximate the integrand by solving a least-squares problem, iii) integrate the approximate function. In high-dimensional applications we face memory limitations due to large storage requirements in step ii). Combining weighted sampling and the randomized extended Kaczmarz algorithm we obtain a new efficient approach to solve large-scale least-squares problems.

At relativistic intensities, the focus has been mainly on investigating various laser beams irradiating initially flat interfaces with little or no control over the interaction. Here, we propose a novel approach that leverages recent advancements in 3D direct laser writing (DLW) of materials and high contrast lasers to manipulate the laser-matter interactions on the micro-scales. We demonstrate, via simulations, that usable intensities >10^23Wcm^(-2) could be achieved with current tabletop lasers coupled to 3D printed plasma lenses. We show that these plasma optical elements act not only as a lens to focus laser light, but also as an electromagnetic guide for secondary particle beams.

"  Recently, highly resolved experiments and simulations have provided detailed insight into the dynamics of turbulent pipe flow. This has revived the interest to identify mechanisms that generate chaotic transients with super-exponential growth of lifetime as a function of a control parameter, the Reynolds number for pipe flow, and with transitions from bounded chaotic patches to an invasion of space of irregular motion. Dynamical systems models are unique tools in this respect because they can provide insight into the origin of the very long life time of puffs, and the dynamical mechanism leading to the transition from puffs to slugs in pipe flow. The present paper contributes to this enterprise by introducing a unidirectionally coupled map lattice. It mimics three of the salient features of pipe-flow turbulence: (i) the transition from laminar flow to puffs, (ii) a super-exponential scaling of puff lifetime, and (iii) the transition from puffs to slugs by an unbinding transition in an intermittency scenario. In our model all transitions and scalings are theoretically described from a dynamical systems point of view.

"  We propose a top quark condensate scenario embedded in grand unified theories (GUTs), stressing that the gauged Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model has a nontrivial continuum limit (``renormalizability'') under certain condition which is actually satisfied in all sensible GUTs with simple group. The top quark mass prediction in this scenario is shown to be insensitive to the ultraviolet cutoff $\Lambda$ thanks to the ``renormalizability''. We also discuss a possibility to reduce the top mass prediction in this scenario. ",Top Quark Condensate in Grand Unified Theories
"  Deployment of machine learning models in real high-risk settings (e.g. healthcare) often depends not only on model's accuracy but also on its fairness, robustness and interpretability. Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) have a long history of use in these high-risk domains, but lack desirable features of deep learning such as differentiability and scalability. In this work, we propose a neural GAM (NODE-GAM) and neural GA$^2$M (NODE-GA$^2$M) that scale well to large datasets, while remaining interpretable and accurate. We show that our proposed models have comparable accuracy to other non-interpretable models, and outperform other GAMs on large datasets. We also show that our models are more accurate in self-supervised learning setting when access to labeled data is limited.

  We propose an idea of eigenstate clustering in non-Hermitian systems. We show that non-orthogonal eigenstates can be clustered around exceptional points and illustrate our idea on some models. We discuss that exponential localization of eigenstates at edges due to the non-Hermitian skin effect is a typical example of eigenstate clustering. We numerically see that clustering of localized or extended eigenstates are possible in systems with both open and closed boundaries. We show that gain and loss can enhance eigenstate clustering. We use fidelities and the standard k-means clustering algorithm for a systematic study of clustered eigenstates. ,Eigenstate clustering around exceptional points

"  Complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology has radically reshaped the world by taking humanity to the digital age. Cramming more transistors into the same physical space has enabled an exponential increase in computational performance, a strategy that has been recently hampered by the increasing complexity and cost of miniaturization. To continue achieving significant gains in computing performance, new computing paradigms, such as quantum computing, must be developed. However, finding the optimal physical system to process quantum information, and scale it up to the large number of qubits necessary to build a general-purpose quantum computer, remains a significant challenge. Recent breakthroughs in nanodevice engineering have shown that qubits can now be manufactured in a similar fashion to silicon field-effect transistors, opening an opportunity to leverage the know-how of the CMOS industry to address the scaling challenge. In this article, we focus on the analysis of the scaling prospects of quantum computing systems based on CMOS technology.

"  This paper proposes two efficient and easy-to-use error mitigation solutions to the problem of three-dimensional (3-D) angle-of-arrival (AOA) source localization in the mixed line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) indoor environments. A weighted linear least squares estimator is derived first for the LOS AOA components in terms of the direction vectors of arrival, albeit in a sub-optimal manner. Next, data selection exploiting the sum of squared residuals is carried out to discard the error-prone NLOS connections. In so doing, the first approach is constituted and more accurate closed-form location estimates can be obtained. The second method applies a simulated annealing stochastic framework to realize the robust $\ell_1$-minimization criterion, which therefore falls into the methodology of statistical robustification. Computer simulations and ultrasonic onsite experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the two proposed methods, demonstrating their outstanding positioning results in the respective scenarios.

"  We calculate heavy quark symmetry breaking in the slopes and curvatures of the $B\to D^{(*)}\ell\bar\nu$ spectra at zero recoil, including the order $\alpha_s^2\beta_0$ corrections. We point out that the theoretical uncertainties in the differences between $B\to D$ and $B\to D^*$ slopes and curvatures are smaller than in the deviations of the slopes and curvatures themselves from their infinite mass limits. We find that the central values of the current experimental results for the difference of the slopes differ from our calculations when QCD sum rules are used to estimate subleading Isgur-Wise functions. A better understanding of the shapes of the $B\to D^{(*)}\ell\bar\nu$ spectra may also help to reduce the error of $|V_{cb}|$ extracted from the zero recoil limit of $B\to D^*\ell\bar\nu$. We argue that heavy quark symmetry requires that the same fitting procedure be used in the experimental determinations of the shape parameters and $|V_{cb}|$ from the $B\to D\ell\bar\nu$ and $B\to D^{*}\ell\bar\nu$ spectra.

"  In this paper, new boundary differential equations for the two-dimensional exterior scattering problem have been derived. It has been shown that the Helmholtz equation can be reduced to an inhomogeneous Bessel's equation in a body-fitted coordinate system. By imposing the Sommerfeld radiation condition to the general solution of the Bessel's equation, an integro-differential equation, which is equivalent to the original Helmholtz equation, can be obtained. The boundary differential equation can then be established by use of the integration by parts to get rid of the integral in the integro-differential equation for high frequency problems. Numerical examples have been presented to demonstrate the validity of the new boundary differential equations. ",Boundary Differential Equations and Their Applications to Scattering   Problems

The radial velocity curves obtained, together with existing OGLE light curves, allowed the determination of all stellar and orbital parameters of these binary systems. The mean distance modulus of the observed part of the SMC is 19.05, based on the 26 most reliable systems. Assuming an average error of 0.1 mag on the distance modulus to an individual system, and a gaussian distribution of the distance moduli, we obtain a 2-sigma depth of 0.36 mag or 10.6 kpc.

"  Electron elastic scattering off a spin-polarized Cr(...$3d^{5}4s^{1}$, $^{7}S$) atom is theoretically studied in the region of electron energies up to $15$ eV using both a one-electron ""spin-polarized"" Hartree-Fock and multielectron ""spin-polarized"" random phase approximation with exchange. It is found that scattering phase shifts of oppositely spin-polarized incoming electrons and corresponding cross sections of the scattering reactions significantly differ from each other, in general, even without accounting for spin-orbit interaction. This is shown to be associated with the presence of two semifilled $3d^{5}$ and $4s^{1}$ subshells in the Cr's configuration which induce considerably different exchange in the interaction of oppositely spin-polarized incoming electrons with the atom-target. The importance of electron correlation in $e^{-}+\rm Cr$ elastic scattering process is revealed. Moreover, correlation is shown to induce strong differences between scattering of oppositely spin-polarized electrons off Cr. A physically transparent interpretation for the latter is provided.

"  We present a first attempt to determine nucleon-nucleon potentials in the parity-odd sector, which appear in 1P1, 3P0, 3P1, 3P2-3F2 channels, in Nf=2 lattice QCD simulations. These potentials are constructed from the Nambu-Bethe-Salpeter wave functions for J^P=0^-, 1^- and 2^-, which correspond to A1^-, T1^- and T2^- + E^- representation of the cubic group, respectively. We have found a large and attractive spin-orbit potential VLS(r) in the isospin-triplet channel, which is qualitatively consistent with the phenomenological determination from the experimental scattering phase shifts. The potentials obtained from lattice QCD are used to calculate the scattering phase shifts in 1P1, 3P0, 3P1 and 3P2-3F2 channels. The strong attractive spin-orbit force and a weak repulsive central force in spin-triplet P-wave channels lead to an attraction in the 3P2 channel, which is related to the P-wave neutron paring in neutron stars.

"  In their Letter [Phys. Rev. Lett. 105, 137402 (2010)], Eisfeld et al. predicted the exchange broadening and blue-shift of the absorption band as well as a nonuniversal disorder scaling of the localization length of excitons in J-aggregates with Levy disorder, which they contrasted with the previously analyzed Gaussian and Lorentzian case [Phys. Rev. B, 79, 1 (2009)]. The observations were explained by chain segmentation due to outliers, and its interplay with localization of states in effective potential wells created by typical random site energies. We argue that the previously known theory does not break down and thus anticipates the properties of absorption band investigated in the commented work.

"  We use the Cambridge stellar evolution code STARS to model the evolution and nucleosynthesis of zero-metallicity intermediate-mass stars. We investigate the effect of duplicity on the nucleosynthesis output of these systems and the potential abundances of the secondaries. The surfaces of zero-metallicity stars are enriched in CNO elements after second dredge up. During binary interaction, such as Roche lobe overflow or wind accretion, metals can be released from these stars and the secondaries enriched in CNO isotopes. We investigate the formation of the two most metal poor stars known, HE 0107-5240 and HE 1327-2326. The observed carbon and nitrogen abundances of HE 0107-5240 can be reproduced by accretion of material from the companion-enhanced wind of a seven solar star after second dredge-up, though oxygen and sodium are underproduced. We speculate that HE 1327-2326, which is richer in nitrogen and strontium, may similarly be formed by wind accretion in a later AGB phase after third dredge-up.

"  We perform three dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of the ram pressure stripping of the hot extended gaseous halo of a massive galaxy using the k-epsilon sub-grid turbulence model at Mach numbers 0.9, 1.1 and 1.9. The k-epsilon model is used to simulate high Reynolds number flows by increasing the transport coefficients in regions of high turbulence. We find that the initial, instantaneous stripping is the same whether or not the k-epsilon model is implemented and is in agreement with the results of other studies. However the use of the k-epsilon model leads to five times less gas remaining after stripping by a supersonic flow has proceeded for 10 Gyr, which is more consistent with what simple analytic calculations indicate. Hence the continual Kelvin-Helmholtz stripping plays a significant role in the ram pressure stripping of the haloes of massive galaxies. To properly account for this, simulations of galaxy clusters will require the use of sub-grid turbulence models ",Ram pressure stripping of the hot gaseous haloes of galaxies using the   k-epsilon sub-grid turbulence model
"  It has recently been suggested that gauge invariance forbids the coupling of a massive color-octet vector meson to two gluons. While this is true for operators in an effective Lagrangian of dimension four or less, we demonstrate that dimension six interactions will lead to such couplings. In the case of technicolor, the result is a technirho-gluon-gluon coupling comparable to the naive vector meson dominance estimate, but with a substantial uncertainty. This has implications for several recent studies of technicolor phenomenology. ",Two-gluon coupling and collider phenomenology of color-octet technirho   mesons

"  Helioseismology puts strong constraints on the internal sound speed and on the rotation profile in the radiative zone. Young stars of solar type are more active and faster rotators than the Sun. So we begin to build models which include different rotation histories and compare the results with all the solar observations. The profiles of the rotation we get have interesting consequence for the introduction of magnetic field in the radiative zone. We discuss also the impact of mass loss deduced from measured flux of young stars. We deduce from these comparisons some quantitative effect of the dynamical processes (rotation, magnetic field and mass loss) of these early stages on the present sound speed and density. We show finally how we can improve our present knowledge of the radiative zone with PICARD and GOLFNG. ",The dynamics of the radiative zone of the Sun
"  The recent trend of using Graphics Processing Units (GPU's) for high performance computations is driven by the high ratio of price performance for these units, complemented by their cost effectiveness. At first glance, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solvers match perfectly to GPU resources because these solvers make intensive calculations and use relatively little memory. Nevertheless, there are scarce results about the practical use of this serious advantage of GPU over CPU, especially for calculations of viscous, compressible, heat-conductive gas flows with double precision accuracy. In this paper, two GPU algorithms according to time approximation of convective terms were presented: explicit and implicit scheme. To decrease data transfers between device memories and increase the arithmetic intensity of a GPU code we minimize the number of kernels. The GPU algorithm was implemented in one kernel for the implicit scheme and two kernels for the explicit scheme. The numerical equations were put together using macros and optimization, data copy from global to private memory, and data reuse were left to the compiler. Thus keeps the code simpler with excellent maintenance. As a test case, we model the flow past squares in a microchannel at supersonic speed. The tests show that overall speedup of AMD Radeon R9 280X is up to 102x compared to Intel Core i5-4690 core and up to 184x compared to Intel Core i7-920 core, while speedup of NVIDIA Tesla M2090 is up to 11x compared to Intel Core i5-4690 core and up to 20x compared to Intel Core i7-920 core. Memory requirements of GPU code are improved compared to CPU one. It requires 1[GB] global memory for 5.9 million finite volumes that are two times less compared to C++ CPU code. After all the code is simple, portable (written in OpenCL), memory efficient and easily modifiable moreover demonstrates excellent performance.

"  We propose a direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation method for Sound Event Localization and Detection (SELD). Direct estimation of DOA using a deep neural network (DNN), i.e. completely-datadriven approach, achieves high accuracy. However, there is a gap in the accuracy between DOA estimation for single and overlapping sources because they cannot incorporate physical knowledge. Meanwhile, although the accuracy of physics-based approaches is inferior to DNN-based approaches, it is robust for overlapping source. In this study, we consider a combination of physics-based and DNN-based approaches; the sound intensity vectors (IVs) for physics-based DOA estimation is refined based on DNN-based denoising and source separation. This method enables the accurate DOA estimation for both single and overlapping sources using a spherical microphone array. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art DOA estimation accuracy on an open dataset of the SELD.

"  It is shown that pairs of solitary pulses (SPs) in a linearly-coupled system with opposite group-velocity dispersions form robust breathing bound states. The system can be realized by temporal-modulation coupling of SPs with different carrier frequencies propagating in the same medium, or by coupling of SPs in a dual-core waveguide. Broad SP pairs are produced in a virtually exact form by means of the variational approximation. Strong nonlinearity tends to destroy the periodic evolution of the SP pairs.

"  The standard treatment of relativistic thermodynamics does not allow for a systematic treatment of mixtures. It is proposed that a formulation of thermodynamics as an action principle may be a suitable approach to adopt for a new investigation. This third paper of the series applies the action principle to a study of mixtures of ideal gases. The action for a mixture of ideal gases is the sum of the actions for the components, with an entropy that, in the absence of gravity, is determined by the Gibbs-Dalton hypothesis. Chemical reactions such as hydrogen dissociation are studied, with results that include the Saha equation and that are more complete than traditional treatments, especially so when gravitational effects are included. A mixture of two ideal gases is a system with two degrees of freedom and consequently it exhibits two kinds of sound. In the presence of gravity the Gibbs-Dalton hypothesis is modified to get results that agree with observation. The possibility of a parallel treatment of real gases is illustrated by an application to van der Waals gases. The overall conclusion is that experimental results serve to pin down the lagrangian in a very efficient manner. This leads to a convenient theoretical framework in which many dynamical problems can be studied. ",Heat and Gravitation. III. Mixtures

"  We study the self-averaging properties of the three dimensional site diluted Heisenberg model. The Harris criterion \cite{critharris} states that disorder is irrelevant since the specific heat critical exponent of the pure model is negative. According with some analytical approaches \cite{harris}, this implies that the susceptibility should be self-averaging at the critical temperature ($R_\chi=0$). We have checked this theoretical prediction for a large range of dilution (including strong dilution) at critically and we have found that the introduction of scaling corrections is crucial in order to obtain self-averageness in this model. Finally we have computed critical exponents and cumulants which compare very well with those of the pure model supporting the Universality predicted by the Harris criterion.

"  Nonlinear Schrodinger Equations (NLS) of the Hartree type occur in the modeling of quantum semiconductor devices. Their ""semiclassical"" limit of vanishing (scaled) Planck constant is both a mathematical challenge and practically relevant when coupling quantum models to classical models.   With the aim of describing the semi-classical limit of the 3D Schrodinger--Poisson system with an additional harmonic potential, we study some semi-classical limits of the Hartree equation with harmonic potential in space dimension n>1. The harmonic potential is confining, and causes focusing periodically in time. We prove asymptotics in several cases, showing different possible nonlinear phenomena according to the interplay of the size of the initial data and the power of the Hartree potential. In the case of the 3D Schrodinger-Poisson system with harmonic potential, we can only give a formal computation since the need of modified scattering operators for this long range scattering case goes beyond current theory. We also deal with the case of an additional ""local"" nonlinearity given by a power of the local density - a model that is relevant when incorporating the Pauli principle in the simplest model given by the ""Schrodinger-Poisson-X$\alpha$ equation"". Further we discuss the connection of our WKB based analysis to the Wigner function approach to semiclassical limits. ",(Semi)classical limit of the Hartree equation with harmonic potential
"  The photometric characterization of M33 star clusters is far from complete. In this paper, we present homogeneous $UBVRI$ photometry of 708 star clusters and cluster candidates in M33 based on archival images from the Local Group Galaxies Survey, which covers 0.8 deg$^2$ along the galaxy's major axis. Our photometry includes 387, 563, 616, 580, and 478 objects in the $UBVRI$ bands, respectively, of which 276, 405, 430, 457, and 363 do not have previously published $UBVRI$ photometry. Our photometry is consistent with previous measurements (where available) in all filters. We adopted Sloan Digital Sky Survey $ugriz$ photometry for complementary purposes, as well as Two Micron All-Sky Survey near-infrared $JHK$ photometry where available. We fitted the spectral-energy distributions of 671 star clusters and candidates to derive their ages, metallicities, and masses based on the updated {\sc parsec} simple stellar populations synthesis models. The results of our $\chi^2$ minimization routines show that only 205 of the 671 clusters ($31\%$) are older than 2 Gyr, which represents a much smaller fraction of the cluster population than that in M31 ($56\%$), suggesting that M33 is dominated by young star clusters ($<1$ Gyr). We investigate the mass distributions of the star clusters---both open and globular clusters---in M33, M31, the Milky Way, and the Large Magellanic Cloud. Their mean values are $\log(M_{\rm cl}/M_{\odot})=4.25$, 5.43, 2.72, and 4.18, respectively. The fraction of open to globular clusters is highest in the Milky Way and lowest in M31. Our comparisons of the cluster ages, masses, and metallicities show that our results are basically in agreement with previous studies (where objects in common are available); differences can be traced back to differences in the models adopted, the fitting methods used, and stochastic sampling effects.

"  Two-dimensional (2D) coupled resonant optical waveguide (CROW), exhibiting topological edge states, provides an efficient platform for designing integrated topological photonic devices. In this paper, we propose an experimentally feasible design of 2D honeycomb CROW photonic structure. The characteristic optical system possesses two-fold and three-fold Dirac points at different positions in the Brillouin zone. The effective gauge fields implemented by the intrinsic pseudo-spin-orbit interaction open up topologically nontrivial bandgaps through the Dirac points. Spatial lattice geometries allow destructive wave interference, leading to a dispersionless, nearly-flat energy band in the vicinity of the three-fold Dirac point in the telecommunication frequency regime. This nontrivial nearly-flat band yields topologically protected edge states. The pertinent physical effects brought about due to non-Hermitian gain/loss medium into the honeycomb CROW device are discussed. The generalized gain-loss lattice with parity-time symmetry decouples the gain and the loss at opposite zigzag edges, leading to purely gain or loss edge channels. Meanwhile, the gain and loss effects on the armchair boundary cancel each other, giving rise to dissipationless edge states in non-Hermitian optical systems. These characteristics underpin the fundamental importance as well as the potential applications in various optical devices such as polarizers, optical couplers, beam splitters and slow light delay lines.

"  In presence of a magnetic field, photons can mix with any particle having a two-photon vertex. In theories with large compact extra-dimensions, there exists a hierachy of massive Kaluza-Klein gravitons that couple to any photon entering a magnetic field. We study this mixing and show that, in comparison with the four dimensional situation where the photon couples only to the massless graviton, the oscillation effect may be enhanced due to the existence of a large number of Kaluza-Klein modes. We give the conditions for such an enhancement and then investigate the cosmological and astrophysical consequences of this phenomenon; we also discuss some laboratory experiments. Axions also couple to photons in the same way; we discuss the effect of the existence of bulk axions in universes with large extra-dimensions. The results can also be applied to neutrino physics with extra-dimensions. ",Photon mixing in universes with large extra-dimensions

While these ""deep latent variable"" models provide a rich, flexible framework for modeling many real-world phenomena, difficulties exist: deep parameterizations of conditional likelihoods usually make posterior inference intractable, and latent variable objectives often complicate backpropagation by introducing points of non-differentiability.

"  We carried out deep searches for CO line emission in the outer disk of M33, at R>7 kpc, and examined the dynamical conditions that can explain variations in the mass distribution of the molecular cloud throughout the disk of M33. We used the IRAM-30~m telescope to search for CO lines in the outer disk toward 12 faint mid-infrared (MIR) selected sources and in an area of the southern outer disk hosting MA1, a bright HII region. We detect narrow CO lines at the location of two MIR sources at galactocentric distances of about 8 kpc that are associated with low-mass young stellar clusters, and at four locations in the proximity of MA1. The paucity of CO lines at the location of weak MIR-selected sources probably arises because most of them are not star-forming sites in M33, but background sources. Although very uncertain, the total molecular mass of the detected clouds around MA1 is lower than expected given the stellar mass of the cluster, because dispersal of the molecular gas is taking place as the HII region expands. The mean mass of the giant molecular clouds (GMCs) in M33 decreases radially by a factor 2 from the center out to 4 kpc, then it stays constant until it drops at R>7 kpc. We suggest that GMCs become more massive toward the center because of the fast rotation of the disk, which drives mass growth by coalescence of smaller condensations as they cross the arms. The analysis of both HI and CO spectral data gives the consistent result that corotation of the two main arms in this galaxy is at a radius of 4.7+-0.3 kpc, and spiral shock waves become subsonic beyond 3.9 kpc. Perturbations are quenched beyond 6.5 kpc, where CO lines have been detected only around sporadic condensations associated with UV and MIR emission.

  We review a new systematic data analysis procedure for color transparency experiments and its application to the proton nucleus scattering experiment. The method extracts the hard scattering rate as well as the survival probability for the protons travelling through the nucleus directly from the data. The method requires modelling of the nuclear attenuation in terms of an effective nucleon-nucleon cross section. We can minimize this model dependence by introducing a new scaling law analysis procedure which can yield considerable information with very little theoretical input. With sufficient data the functional forms of the survival probability as well as the hard scattering can be extracted without any theoretical modelling. An analysis of the BNL data of Carroll {\it et al} shows clear evidence for observation of color transparency. ,Evidence for Observation of Color Transparency in pa Collisions Using   Global Fit and Scaling Law Analysis

How can one find all rational orthogonal matrices $Q\in{O_n(\mathbb{Q})}$ such that $Q^TAQ\in {S_n(\mathbb{Z})}$, and in particular, when does $Q^TAQ\in {S_n(\mathbb{Z})}$ with $Q\in{O_n(\mathbb{Q})}$ imply that $Q$ is \emph{a signed permutation matrix} (i.e., the matrix obtained from a permutation matrix $P$ by replacing each 1 in $P$ with 1 or $-1$)?   A surprisingly simple answer was given in terms of whether the discriminant of the characteristic polynomial of $A$ is odd and square-free, which partially answers the above questions. More precisely, let $\Delta_A=\pm \res(\phi,\phi')$ be \emph{the discriminant of matrix $A$}, where $\res(\phi,\phi')$ is \emph{the resultant} of the characteristic polynomial $\phi$ of $A$ and its derivative $\phi'$. We show that if $\Delta_A$ is odd and square-free, then $Q^TAQ\in {S_n(\mathbb{Z})}$ with $Q\in{O_n(\mathbb{Q})}$ implies that $Q$ is a signed permutation matrix.

From the room temperature Raman scattering, it is apparent that the electron-phonon coupling is sensitive to the presence of both the Fe and Cr at the B-site. Essentially, an Ag like local oxygen breathing mode is activated due to the charge transfer between Fe3+ - Cr3+ at around 670 cm-1, this observation is explained on the basis of Franck-Condon (FC) mechanism. Optical absorption studies infer that there exists a direct band gap in the HoFe1-xCrxO3 compounds. Decrease in band gap until x = 0.5 is ascribed to the broadening of the oxygen p orbitals as a result of the induced spin disorder due to Fe3+ and Cr3+ at B site. In contrast, the increase in band gap above x = 0.5 is explained on the basis of the reduction in the available unoccupied d - orbitals of Fe3+ at the conduction band. We believe that above results would be helpful for the development of the optoelectronic devices based on the ortho-ferrites.

"  Biomedical entity linking is the task of identifying mentions of biomedical concepts in text documents and mapping them to canonical entities in a target thesaurus. Recent advancements in entity linking using BERT-based models follow a retrieve and rerank paradigm, where the candidate entities are first selected using a retriever model, and then the retrieved candidates are ranked by a reranker model. While this paradigm produces state-of-the-art results, they are slow both at training and test time as they can process only one mention at a time. To mitigate these issues, we propose a BERT-based dual encoder model that resolves multiple mentions in a document in one shot. We show that our proposed model is multiple times faster than existing BERT-based models while being competitive in accuracy for biomedical entity linking. Additionally, we modify our dual encoder model for end-to-end biomedical entity linking that performs both mention span detection and entity disambiguation and out-performs two recently proposed models.

"  In this paper we study a continuity of the ""values"" of modular functions at the real quadratic numbers which are defined in terms of their cycle integrals along the associated closed geodesics. Our main theorem reveals a more finer structure of the continuity of these values with respect to continued fraction expansions and it turns out that it is different from the continuity with respect to Euclidean topology.

"  The inclusive energy distributions of fragments (3$\leq$Z$\leq$7) emitted in the reaction $^{16}$O + $^{27}$Al at $E_{lab} = $116 MeV have been measured in the angular range $\theta_{lab} $= 15$^\circ$ - 115$^\circ$. A non-linear optimisation procedure using multiple Gaussian distribution functions has been proposed to extract the fusion-fission and deep inelastic components of the fragment emission from the experimental data. The angular distributions of the fragments, thus obtained, from the deep inelastic component are found to fall off faster than those from the fusion-fission component, indicating shorter life times of the emitting di-nuclear systems. The life times of the intermediate di-nuclear configurations have been estimated using a diffractive Regge-pole model. The life times thus extracted ($\sim 1 - 5\times 10^{-22}$ Sec.) are found to decrease with the increase in the fragment charge. Optimum Q-values are also found to increase with increasing charge transfer i.e. with the decrease in fragment charge. ",Dissipative collisions in $^{16}$O + $^{27}$Al at E$_{lab}$=116 MeV

"  Future mobile networks supporting Internet of Things are expected to provide both high throughput and low latency to user-specific services. One way to overcome this challenge is to adopt network function virtualization and Multi-access edge computing (MEC). In this paper, we analyze an end-to-end communication system that consists of both MEC servers and a server at the core network hosting different types of virtual network functions. We develop a queueing model for the performance analysis of the system consisting of both processing and transmission flows. The system is decomposed into subsystems which are independently analyzed in order to approximate the behaviour of the original system. We provide closed-form expressions of the performance metrics such as system drop rate and average number of tasks in the system. Simulation results show that our approximation performs quite well. By evaluating the system under different scenarios, we provide insights for the decision making on traffic flow control and its impact on critical performance metrics.

"  Anomalous metals are observed in numerous experiments on disordered two-dimensional systems proximate to superconductivity. A characteristic feature of an anomalous metal is that its low temperature conductivity has a weakly temperature dependent value, significantly higher than that of a disordered Fermi liquid. We propose a dynamical mean-field model of an anomalous metal: interacting electrons similar in structure to that of the well-studied universal Hamiltonian of mesoscopic metallic grains, but with independent random interactions between pairs of sites, involving Cooper pair hopping and spin exchange. We find evidence for critical anomalous phases or points between a superconducting phase and a disordered Fermi liquid phase in this model. Our results are obtained by a renormalization group analysis in a weak coupling limit, and a complementary solution at large $M$ when the spin symmetry is generalized to USp($M$). The large $M$ limit describes the anomalous metal by fractionalization of the electron into spinons, holons, and doublons, with these partons forming critical non-Fermi liquids in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev class. We compute the low temperature conductivity in the large $M$ limit, and find temperature-independent values moderately enhanced from that in the disordered metal.

"  We report the results from a pilot search for radio recombination line (RRL) emission at millimeter wavelengths in a small sample of pre-planetary nebulae (pPNe) and young PNe (yPNe) with emerging central ionized regions. Observations of the H30\alpha, H31a, H39a, H41a, H48b, H49b, H51b, and H55g lines at 1 and 3mm have been performed with the IRAM 30 m radio telescope. These lines are excellent probes of the dense inner (<~150 au) and heavily obscured regions of these objects, where the yet unknown agents for PN-shaping originate. We detected mm-RRLs in three objects: CRL 618, MWC 922, and M 2-9. For CRL 618, the only pPN with previous published detections of H41a, H35a, and H30a emission, we find significant changes in the line profiles indicating that current observations are probing regions of the ionized wind with larger expansion velocities and mass-loss rate than ~29 years ago. In the case of MWC 922, we observe a drastic transition from single-peaked profiles at 3mm to double-peaked profiles at 1mm, which is consistent with maser amplification of the highest frequency lines; the observed line profiles are compatible with rotation and expansion of the ionized gas, probably arranged in a disk+wind system around a ~5-10 Msun central mass. In M 2-9, the mm-RRL emission appears to be tracing a recent mass outburst by one of the stars of the central binary system. We present the results from non-LTE line and continuum radiative transfer models, which enables us to constrain the structure, kinematics, and physical conditions (electron temperature and density) of the ionized cores of our sample. (abridged). We deduce mass-loss rates of ~1e-6-1e-7 Msun/yr, which are significantly higher than the values adopted by stellar evolution models currently in use and would result in a transition from the asymptotic giant branch to the PN phase faster than hitherto assumed.

"  We investigate a spectrum oligopoly market where primaries lease their channels to secondaries in lieu of financial remuneration. Transmission quality of a channel evolves randomly. Each primary has to select the price it would quote without knowing the transmission qualities of its competitors' channels. Each secondary buys a channel depending on the price and the transmission quality a channel offers. We formulate the price selection problem as a non co-operative game with primaries as players. In the one-shot game, we show that there exists a unique symmetric Nash Equilibrium(NE) strategy profile and explicitly compute it. Our analysis reveals that under the NE strategy profile a primary prices its channel to render high quality channel more preferable to the secondary; this negates the popular belief that prices ought to be selected to render channels equally preferable to the secondary regardless of their qualities. We show the loss of revenue in the asymptotic limit due to the non co-operation of primaries. In the repeated version of the game, we characterize a subgame perfect NE where a primary can attain a payoff arbitrarily close to the payoff it would obtain when primaries co-operate.

"  We study the use of parallax microlensing to separate the effects of the mass function of dark massive halo objects (MHOs or `machos') on the one hand and their spatial distribution and kinematics on the other. This disentanglement is supposed to allow a much better determination of the two than could be achieved entirely on the basis of the durations of events. We restrict our treatment to the same class of power-law spherical models for the halo of MHOs studied in a previous paper (astro-ph/9609187). Whereas the duration-based error in the average MHO mass, \mu exceeds (at N=100 events) \mu by a factor of 2 or more, parallax microlensing remarkably brings it down to 15-20% of \mu, regardless of the shape of the mass function. In addition, the slope \alpha of the mass function, dn/d\mu\propto\mu^{\alpha}, can be inferred relatively accurately (\sigma_{\alpha} < 0.4) for a broader range, -3 <\alpha < 0. The improvement in the inference of the halo structure is also significant: the index \gamma of the density profile (\rho\sim R^{-\gamma}) can be obtained with the error \sigma_{\gamma} <0.4. While in a typical situation the errors for the parameters specifying the velocity dispersion profile are of about the same magnitude as the parameters themselves, virtually all the uncertainty is `concentrated' in linear combinations of the parameters that may have little influence on the profile and thus allow its reasonably accurate inference.

"  In this paper, we develop a scalable system which can do real-time analytics for different health applications. The occurrence of different health conditions can be regarded as the complex events and thus this concept can be extended to other use cases easily. Large number of users should be able to send the data in real-time, and should be able to receive the feedback and result. Keeping the requirements in mind we used Kafka and Spark to develop our system. In this setting, multiple users are running Kafka producer clients, which are sending data in real-time.

"  We investigate the effects excluded volume on the stretching of a single DNA in solution. We find that for small force F, the extension h is not linear in F but proportion to F^{\chi}, with \chi=(1-\nu)/\nu, where \nu is the well-known universal correlation length exponent. A freely joint chain model with the segment length chosen to reproduce the small extension behavior gives excellent fit to the experimental data of \lambda-Phage DNA over the whole experimental range. We show that excluded volume effects are stronger in two dimensions and also derive results in two dimensions which are different from the three dimensional results. This suggests experiments to be performed in these lower dimensions. ",Excluded Volume Effects in Gene Stretching
"  We use the Gaia-TGAS data to compare the transverse velocities in Galactic longitude (coming from proper motions and parallaxes) in the Milky Way disk for negative and positive longitudes as a function of distance. The transverse velocities are strongly asymmetric and deviate significantly from the expectations for an axisymmetric Galaxy. The value and sign of the asymmetry changes at spatial scales of several tens of degrees in Galactic longitude and about 0.5 kpc in distance. The asymmetry is statistically significant at 95% confidence level for 57% of the region probed, which extends up to ~1.2 kpc. A percentage of 24% of the region studied shows absolute differences at this confidence level larger than 5 km/s and 7% larger than 10 km/s. The asymmetry pattern shows mild variations in the vertical direction and with stellar type. A first qualitative comparison with spiral arm models indicates that the arms are unlikely to be the main source of the asymmetry. We briefly discuss alternative origins. This is the first time that global all-sky asymmetries are detected in the Milky Way kinematics, beyond the local neighbourhood, and with a purely astrometric sample.

"  We present observations of the optical afterglow of GRB\,170817A, made by the {\it Hubble Space Telescope}, between February and August 2018, up to one year after the neutron star merger, GW170817. The afterglow shows a rapid decline beyond $170$~days, and confirms the jet origin for the observed outflow, in contrast to more slowly declining expectations for `failed-jet' scenarios. We show here that the broadband (radio, optical, X-ray) afterglow is consistent with a structured outflow where an ultra-relativistic jet, with Lorentz factor $\Gamma\gtrsim100$, forms a narrow core ($\sim5^\circ$) and is surrounded by a wider angular component that extends to $\sim15^\circ$, which is itself relativistic ($\Gamma\gtrsim5$). For a two-component model of this structure, the late-time optical decline, where $F \propto t^{-\alpha}$, is $\alpha=2.20\pm0.18$, and for a Gaussian structure the decline is $\alpha=2.45\pm0.23$. We find the Gaussian model to be consistent with both the early $\sim10$ days and late $\gtrsim290$ days data. The agreement of the optical light curve with the evolution of the broadband spectral energy distribution and its continued decline indicates that the optical flux is arising primarily from the afterglow and not any underlying host system. This provides the deepest limits on any host stellar cluster, with a luminosity $\lesssim 4000 L_\odot~(M_{\rm F606W}\gtrsim-4.3)$. ",The optical afterglow of GW170817 at one year post-merger

"  Standard video encoders developed for conventional narrow field-of-view video are widely applied to 360{\deg} video as well, with reasonable results. However, while this approach commits arbitrarily to a projection of the spherical frames, we observe that some orientations of a 360{\deg} video, once projected, are more compressible than others. We introduce an approach to predict the sphere rotation that will yield the maximal compression rate. Given video clips in their original encoding, a convolutional neural network learns the association between a clip's visual content and its compressibility at different rotations of a cubemap projection. Given a novel video, our learning-based approach efficiently infers the most compressible direction in one shot, without repeated rendering and compression of the source video. We validate our idea on thousands of video clips and multiple popular video codecs. The results show that this untapped dimension of 360{\deg} compression has substantial potential--""good"" rotations are typically 8-10% more compressible than bad ones, and our learning approach can predict them reliably 82% of the time.

"  With the ever-increasing pervasiveness of the cloud computing paradigm, strong isolation guarantees and low performance overhead from isolation platforms are paramount. An ideal isolation platform offers both: an impermeable isolation boundary while imposing a negligible performance overhead. In this paper, we examine various isolation platforms (containers, secure containers, hypervisors, unikernels), and conduct a wide array of experiments to measure the performance overhead and degree of isolation offered by the platforms. We find that container platforms have the best, near-native, performance while the newly emerging secure containers suffer from various overheads. The highest degree of isolation is achieved by unikernels, closely followed by traditional containers. ",A Fresh Look at the Architecture and Performance of Contemporary   Isolation Platforms
"  LogicWeb has traditionally lacked devices for expressing mutually exclusive clauses. We address this limitation by adopting choice-conjunctive clauses of the form $D_0 \adc D_1$ where $D_0, D_1$ are Horn clauses and $\adc$ is a linear logic connective. Solving a goal $G$ using $D_0 \adc D_1$ -- $\prov(D_0 \adc D_1,G)$ -- has the following operational semantics: choose a successful one between $\prov(D_0,G)$ and $\prov(D_1,G)$. In other words, if $D_o$ is chosen in the course of solving $G$, then $D_1$ will be discarded and vice versa. Hence, the class of choice-conjunctive clauses precisely captures the notion of mutually exclusive clauses. ",Mutually Exclusive Rules in LogicWeb
"  Hafnium carbides are studied by a systematic search for possible stable stoichiometric compounds in the Hf-C system at ambient pressure using variable-composition ab initio evolutionary algorithm implemented in the USPEX code. In addition to well-known HfC, we predicted two additional compounds Hf3C2 and Hf6C5. The structure of Hf6C5 with space group C2/m contains 11 atoms in the primitive cell and this prediction revives the earlier proposal by A. I. Gusev. The stable structure of Hf3C2 also has space group C2/m, and is more energetically favorable than the Immm, P-3m1, P2 and C2221 structures put forward by A. I. Gusev. Dynamical and mechanical stability of the newly predicted structures have been verified by calculations of their phonons and elastic constants. The bulk and shear moduli of Hf3C2 are 195.8 GPa and 143.1 GPa, respectively, while for Hf6C5 they are 227.9 GPa and 187.2 GPa, respectively. Their mechanical properties are inferior to those of HfC due to the presence of structural vacancies. Chemical bonding, band structure, and Bader charge are presented and discussed.

"  The efficient simulation of the mean value of a non-linear functional of the solution to a linear stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) with additive Gaussian noise is considered. A Galerkin finite element method is employed along with an implicit Euler scheme to arrive at a fully discrete approximation of the mild solution to the equation. A scheme is presented to compute the covariance of this approximation, which allows for rapid sampling in a Monte Carlo method. This is then extended to a multilevel Monte Carlo method, for which a scheme to compute the cross-covariance between the approximations at different levels is presented. In contrast to traditional path-based methods it is not assumed that the Galerkin subspaces at these levels are nested. The computational complexities of the presented schemes are compared to traditional methods and simulations confirm that, under suitable assumptions, the costs of the new schemes are significantly lower.

"  Dynamic discrete choice models are used to estimate the intertemporal preferences of an agent as described by a reward function based upon observable histories of states and implemented actions. However, in many applications, such as reliability and healthcare, the system state is only partially observable or hidden (e.g., the level of deterioration of an engine, the condition of a disease), and the decision maker only has access to information imperfectly correlated with the true value of the hidden state. In this paper, we consider the estimation of a dynamic discrete choice model with state variables and system dynamics hidden to both the agent and the modeler, thus generalizing the model in Rust(1987) to partially observable cases. We examine the structural properties of the model and prove that this model is still identifiable if the cardinality of the state space, the discount factor, the distribution of random shocks, and the rewards for a given (reference) action are given. We analyze both theoretically and numerically the potential mis-specification errors that may be incurred when the Rust's model is improperly used in partially observable settings. We further apply the model to a subset of dataset in Rust(1987) for bus engine mileage and replacement decisions. The results show that our model can improve model fit as measured by the $\log$-likelihood function by $17.73\%$ and the $\log$-likelihood ratio test shows that our model statistically outperforms the Rust's model. Interestingly, our hidden state model also reveals an economically meaningful route assignment behavior in the dataset which was hitherto ignored, i.e. routes with lower mileage are assigned to buses believed to be in worse condition.

"  We study the symmetry classes of graphene quantum dots, both open and closed, through the conductance and energy level statistics. For abrupt termination of the lattice, these properties are well described by the standard orthogonal and unitary ensembles. However, for smooth mass confinement, special time-reversal symmetries associated with the sublattice and valley degrees of freedom are critical: they lead to block diagonal Hamiltonians and scattering matrices with blocks belonging to the unitary symmetry class even at zero magnetic field. While the effect of this structure is clearly seen in the conductance of open dots, it is suppressed in the spectral statistics of closed dots, because the intervalley scattering time is shorter than the time required to resolve a level spacing in the closed systems but longer than the escape time of the open systems.

"  This paper extends the Lorentz-Abraham model of an electron (i.e. the equations of motion for a small spherical shell of charge, which is rigid in its proper frame) to treat a small spherically symmetric charge distribution, allowing for small internal dipolar motion. This is done by dividing the distribution into thin spherical shells (in the continuum limit), and tracking the interactions between shells. Dipolar motion of each constituent spherical shell is allowed along the net dipole moment, but higher order multipole-moments are ignored. The amplitude of dipolar motion of each spherical shell is assumed to be linearly proportional to the net dipole moment. Under these assumptions, low velocity equations of motion are determined for both the center-of-mass motion and net dipolar motion of the distribution. This is then generalized to arbitrary (relativistic) center-of-mass velocity and acceleration, assuming the motion of individual shells is completely in phase or out of phase with the net dipole moment.

"  We study a model of an equal mixture of two species of fermions in a deep optical lattice at a filling of two fermions per site. At weak inter-species interaction, the system is a band insulator. When the inter-species interaction is tuned via a Feshbach resonance to be larger than an energy related to the energy separation of the first and second Bloch band, atoms populate equally the two Bloch bands. With weak tunneling between sites of the optical lattice, the system becomes a Mott insulator with the low energy effective Hamiltonian of a spin-1 Heisenberg antiferromagnet, because of a Hund's rule like coupling between the two bands. We discuss experimental signatures of these two types of insulators. ",Fermions in optical lattices near a Feshbach resonance: from band   insulator to Mott insulator
"  We study the position distribution $P(\vec{R},N)$ of a run-and-tumble particle (RTP) in arbitrary dimension $d$, after $N$ runs. We assume that the constant speed $v>0$ of the particle during each running phase is independently drawn from a probability distribution $W(v)$ and that the direction of the particle is chosen isotropically after each tumbling. The position distribution is clearly isotropic, $P(\vec{R},N)\to P(R,N)$ where $R=|\vec{R}|$. We show that, under certain conditions on $d$ and $W(v)$ and for large $N$, a condensation transition occurs at some critical value of $R=R_c\sim O(N)$ located in the large deviation regime of $P(R,N)$. For $R<R_c$ (subcritical fluid phase), all runs are roughly of the same size in a typical trajectory. In contrast, an RTP trajectory with $R>R_c$ is typically dominated by a `condensate', i.e., a large single run that subsumes a finite fraction of the total displacement (supercritical condensed phase). Focusing on the family of speed distributions $W(v)=\alpha(1-v/v_0)^{\alpha-1}/v_0$, parametrized by $\alpha>0$, we show that, for large $N$, $P(R,N)\sim \exp\left[-N\psi_{d,\alpha}(R/N)\right]$ and we compute exactly the rate function $\psi_{d,\alpha}(z)$ for any $d$ and $\alpha$. We show that the transition manifests itself as a singularity of this rate function at $R=R_c$ and that its order depends continuously on $d$ and $\alpha$. We also compute the distribution of the condensate size for $R>R_c$. Finally, we study the model when the total duration $T$ of the RTP, instead of the total number of runs, is fixed. Our analytical predictions are confirmed by numerical simulations, performed using a constrained Markov chain Monte Carlo technique, with precision $\sim 10^{-100}$.

"  A formula of steady shear viscosity is derived by introducing a model to describe the dynamics of physically cross-linked network (physical gel), and successfully analyzes the shear-thickening behavior observed in HEUR aqueous solutions by Jenkins, Sileibi and El-Aasser. We take into account the effects of looped chains at junctions which detach their one end from the junction as the shear rate increases due to the collisions with other chains. This process produces the weak and wide enhancement of the number of chains whose both ends stick to the separate junctions (active chains) leading to the weak increase in the shear viscosity. It is also shown that the nonlinear force sustained by active chains induces the strong and sharp enhancement of the steady shear viscosity. ",Analysis of Shear-Thickening in Physical Gel.

"  It is hypothesised that the avian compass relies on spin dynamics in a recombining radical pair. Quantum coherence has been suggested as a resource to this process that nature may utilise to achieve increased compass sensitivity. To date, most theoretical studies have been conducted for toy radical pair models. Consequently, the true functional role of coherence in these natural systems has remained speculative. Here, we investigate large radical pair models with up to 21 nuclear spins, inspired by the putative magnetosensory protein cryptochrome. By varying relative radical orientations, we reveal correlations of several coherence measures with compass fidelity. Whilst electronic coherence is found to be an ineffective predictor of compass sensitivity, a robust correlation of compass sensitivity and a global coherence measure is established. The results demonstrate the importance of realistic models, and appropriate choice of coherence measure, in elucidating the quantum nature of the avian compass.

It is observed that high confidence labels during training cause the overfitting problem and DL selects disturb labels at random regardless of the confidence of labels. To solve this shortcoming of DL, we propose Directional DisturbLabel (DDL) a novel regularization technique that makes use of the class probabilities to infer the confident labels and using these labels to regularize the model. This active regularization makes use of the model behavior during training to regularize it in a more directed manner. To address regression problems, we also propose DisturbValue (DV), and DisturbError (DE). DE uses only predefined confident labels to disturb target values. DV injects noise into a portion of target values at random similar to DL. In this paper, 6 and 8 datasets are used to validate the robustness of our methods in classification and regression tasks respectively. Finally, we demonstrate that our methods are either comparable to or outperform DisturbLabel, L2 regularization, and Dropout. Also, we achieve the best performance in more than half the datasets by combining our methods with either L2 regularization or Dropout. ",Disturbing Target Values for Neural Network Regularization
"  Bias is a common problem in today's media, appearing frequently in text and in visual imagery. Users on social media websites such as Twitter need better methods for identifying bias. Additionally, activists --those who are motivated to effect change related to some topic, need better methods to identify and counteract bias that is contrary to their mission. With both of these use cases in mind, in this paper we propose a novel tool called UnbiasedCrowd that supports identification of, and action on bias in visual news media. In particular, it addresses the following key challenges (1) identification of bias; (2) aggregation and presentation of evidence to users; (3) enabling activists to inform the public of bias and take action by engaging people in conversation with bots. We describe a preliminary study on the Twitter platform that explores the impressions that activists had of our tool, and how people reacted and engaged with online bots that exposed visual bias. We conclude by discussing design and implication of our findings for creating future systems to identify and counteract the effects of news bias.

"  We present initial results on a comprehensive model of structured communications, in which self- adaptation and security concerns are jointly addressed. More specifically, we propose a model of self-adaptive, multiparty communications with secure information flow guarantees. In this model, security violations occur when processes attempt to read or write messages of inappropriate security levels within directed exchanges. Such violations trigger adaptation mechanisms that prevent the violations to occur and/or to propagate their effect in the choreography. Our model is equipped with local and global mechanisms for reacting to security violations; type soundness results ensure that global protocols are still correctly executed, while the system adapts itself to preserve security.

  Several integration schemes exits to solve the equations of motion of the $N$-body problem. The Lie-integration method is based on the idea to solve ordinary differential equations with Lie-series. In the 1980s this method was applied for the $N$-body problem by giving the recurrence formula for the calculation of the Lie-terms. The aim of this works is to present the recurrence formulae for the linearized equations of motion of $N$-body systems. We prove a lemma which greatly simplifies the derivation of the recurrence formulae for the linearized equations if the recurrence formulae for the equations of motions are known. The Lie-integrator is compared with other well-known methods. The optimal step size and order of the Lie-integrator are calculated. It is shown that a fine-tuned Lie-integrator can be 30%-40% faster than other integration methods. ,Solving Linearized Equations of the $N$-body Problem Using the   Lie-integration Method
"  We present a method to compute non-perturbatively the renormalization constant of the scalar density for Ginsparg-Wilson fermions. It relies on chiral symmetry and is based on a matching of renormalization group invariant masses at fixed pseudoscalar meson mass, making use of results previously obtained by the ALPHA Collaboration for O(a)-improved Wilson fermions. Our approach is quite general and enables the renormalization of scalar and pseudoscalar densities in lattice regularizations that preserve chiral symmetry and of fermion masses in any regularization. As an application we compute the non-perturbative factor which relates the renormalization group invariant quark condensate to its bare counterpart, obtained with overlap fermions at beta=5.85 in the quenched approximation.

In this document, we explore the application of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and other sequence-based neural network architectures to classify jets, regress jet-related quantities and to build a physics-inspired jet representation, in connection to jet clustering algorithms. In addition, alternatives to sequential data representations are briefly discussed. ",Sequence-based Machine Learning Models in Jet Physics
"  We obtain a complete asymptotic expansion for the eigenvalues of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps associated with Schr\""odinger operators on compact Riemannian surfaces with boundary. For the zero potential, we recover the well-known spectral asymptotics for the Steklov problem. For nonzero potentials, we obtain new geometric invariants determined by the spectrum of what we call the parametric Steklov problem. In particular, for constant potentials parametric Steklov problem, the total geodesic curvature on each connected component of the boundary is a spectral invariant. Under the constant curvature assumption, this allows us to obtain some interior information from the spectrum of these boundary operators.

"  We use a coarse-grained molecular dynamics model to study the electrophoretic behaviour of flexible polyelectrolyte chains. We first characterize the static properties of the model with respect to the chain length, the polyelectrolyte concentration, additional salt and the influence of an applied external field. Next we investigate the dynamic behaviour in the oligomer range and compare to data obtained by two different experimental methods, namely capillary electrophoresis and PFG-NMR. We find excellent agreement of experiments and simulations when hydrodynamic interactions are accounted for in the simulations. We then present novel estimators for the dynamical effective charge during free solution electrophoresis and compare them to static estimators. We find complete agreement between the static and the dynamic estimators. We further evaluate the scaling behaviour of the effective friction of the polyelectrolyte-counterion complex with the surrounding fluid. We identify a hydrodynamic screening length beyond which the friction during electrophoresis is linear depending on the chain length resulting in a constant mobility for long polyelectrolyte chains. Our results show a convincing agreement with experimental data and demonstrate that it is possible to model dynamic behaviour of polyelectrolytes using coarse grained models, provided they include the effects of hydrodynamical interactions.

Both, differential conductance as a function of bias voltage and magnetoconductance of individual wires display conductance fluctuations.

"  Previous math word problem solvers following the encoder-decoder paradigm fail to explicitly incorporate essential math symbolic constraints, leading to unexplainable and unreasonable predictions. Herein, we propose Neural-Symbolic Solver (NS-Solver) to explicitly and seamlessly incorporate different levels of symbolic constraints by auxiliary tasks. Our NS-Solver consists of a problem reader to encode problems, a programmer to generate symbolic equations, and a symbolic executor to obtain answers. Along with target expression supervision, our solver is also optimized via 4 new auxiliary objectives to enforce different symbolic reasoning: a) self-supervised number prediction task predicting both number quantity and number locations; b) commonsense constant prediction task predicting what prior knowledge (e.g. how many legs a chicken has) is required; c) program consistency checker computing the semantic loss between predicted equation and target equation to ensure reasonable equation mapping; d) duality exploiting task exploiting the quasi duality between symbolic equation generation and problem's part-of-speech generation to enhance the understanding ability of a solver. Besides, to provide a more realistic and challenging benchmark for developing a universal and scalable solver, we also construct a new large-scale MWP benchmark CM17K consisting of 4 kinds of MWPs (arithmetic, one-unknown linear, one-unknown non-linear, equation set) with more than 17K samples.

"  The specific heat C of a sintered polycrystalline sample of MgB2 with a bulk superconducting transition temperature Tc=36.7 K is measured as a function of the temperature (2-300 K) and magnetic field (0-16 T), together with magnetic properties (normal-state susceptibility, superconducting state magnetization, etc.). The Sommerfeld constant gamma=0.89+-0.05 mJ/K^2/gat (2.7 mJ/K^2/mol) is determined in the normal state above Hc2. The normal- and superconducting state entropies are equal at Tc. Several moments of the phonon density of states are obtained from the lattice specific heat. We report bulk values for: the thermodynamic critical field, the slope of the upper critical field, the Ginzburg-Landau parameter, the coherence length, the lower critical field, the London penetration depth. These results characterize MgB2 as a type-II superconductor. The nearly quadratic dependence of C(T) versus T at T<<Tc, its non-linear field dependence, and the discrepancy between the electron-phonon coupling constant lambda_ep as determined by the renormalization of the electron density-of-states (lambda_ep=0.6) and by McMillan's equation for isotropic superconductors (lambda_ep=1.1), are inconsistent with a single isotropic gap. In addition to high phonon frequencies, anisotropy or two-band gap structure may explain why the critical temperature of this superconductor is high in spite of its low condensation energy, which does not exceed 1/16 of that of YBa2Cu3O7 and 1/4 of that of Nb3Sn.

"  We delineate equilibrium phase structure and topological charge distribution of dense two-colour QCD at low temperature by using a lattice simulation with two-flavour Wilson fermions that has a chemical potential $\mu$ and a diquark source $j$ incorporated. We systematically measure the diquark condensate, the Polyakov loop, the quark number density and the chiral condensate with improved accuracy and $j\to0$ extrapolation over earlier publications; the known qualitative features of the low temperature phase diagram, which is composed of the hadronic, Bose-Einstein condensed (BEC) and BCS phases, are reproduced. In addition, we newly find that around the boundary between the hadronic and BEC phases, nonzero quark number density occurs even in the hadronic phase in contrast to the prediction of the chiral perturbation theory (ChPT), while the diquark condensate approaches zero in a manner that is consistent with the ChPT prediction. At the highest $\mu$, which is of order the inverse of the lattice spacing, all the above observables change drastically, which implies a lattice artifact. Finally, at temperature of order $0.45T_c$, where $T_c$ is the chiral transition temperature at zero chemical potential, the topological susceptibility is calculated from a gradient-flow method and found to be almost constant for all the values of $\mu$ ranging from the hadronic to BCS phase. This is a contrast to the case of $0.89T_c$ in which the topological susceptibility becomes small as the hadronic phase changes into the quark-gluon plasma phase.

"  A stochastic version of the Barkai-Leibler model of chemotaxis receptors in {\it E. coli} is studied here to elucidate the effects of intrinsic network noise in their conformational dynamics. It was originally proposed to explain the robust and near-perfect adaptation of {\it E. coli} observed across a wide range of spatially uniform attractant/repellent (ligand) concentrations. A receptor is either active or inactive and can stochastically switch between the two states. Enzyme CheR methylates inactive receptors while CheB demethylates active ones and the probability for it to be active depends on its level of methylation and ligandation. A simple version of the model with two methylation sites per receptor (M=2) shows zero-order ultrasensitivity (ZOU) akin to the classical 2-state model of covalent modification studied by Goldbeter and Koshland (GK). For extremely small and large ligand concentrations, the system reduces to two 2-state GK modules. A quantitative measure of the spontaneous fluctuations in activity (variance) estimated mathematically under linear noise approximation (LNA) is found to peak near the ZOU transition. The variance is a weak, non-monotonic and decreasing functions of ligand and receptor concentrations. Gillespie simulations for M=2 show excellent agreement with analytical results obtained under LNA. Numerical results for M=2, 3 and 4 show ZOU in mean activity; the variance is found to be smaller for larger M. The magnitude of receptor noise deduced from available experimental data is consistent with our predictions. A simple analysis of the downstream signaling pathway shows that this noise is large enough to have a beneficial effect on the motility of the organism. The response of mean receptor activity to small time-dependent changes in the external ligand concentration, computed within linear response theory, is found to have a bilobe form.

"  Although First Person Vision systems can sense the environment from the user's perspective, they are generally unable to predict his intentions and goals. Since human activities can be decomposed in terms of atomic actions and interactions with objects, intelligent wearable systems would benefit from the ability to anticipate user-object interactions. Even if this task is not trivial, the First Person Vision paradigm can provide important cues to address this challenge. We propose to exploit the dynamics of the scene to recognize next-active-objects before an object interaction begins. We train a classifier to discriminate trajectories leading to an object activation from all others and forecast next-active-objects by analyzing fixed-length trajectory segments within a temporal sliding window.

"  Thirty years ago, I introduced a non commutative variant of classical linear logic, called POMSET LOGIC, issued from a particular denotational semantics or categorical interpretation of linear logic known as coherence spaces. In addition to the multiplicative connectives of linear logic, pomset logic includes a non-commutative connective, ""$<$"" called BEFORE, which is associative and self-dual: $(A<B)^\perp=A^\perp < B^\perp$ (observe that there is no swapping), and pomset logic handles Partially Ordered MultiSETs of formulas. This classical calculus enjoys a proof net calculus, cut-elimination, denotational semantics, but had no sequent calculus, despite my many attempts and the study of closely related deductive systems like the calculus of structures. At the same period, Alain Lecomte introduced me to Lambek calculus and grammars. We defined a grammatical formalism based on pomset logic, with partial proof nets as the deductive systems for parsing-as-deduction, with a lexicon mapping words to partial proof nets. The study of pomset logic and of its grammatical applications has been out of the limelight for several years, in part because computational linguists were not too keen on proof nets. However, recently Sergey Slavnov found a sequent calculus for pomset logic, and reopened the study of pomset logic. In this paper we shall present pomset logic including both published and unpublished material. Just as for Lambek calculus, Pomset logic also is a non commutative variant of linear logic --- although Lambek calculus appeared 30 years before linear logic ! --- and as in Lambek calculus it may be used as a grammar. Apart from this the two calculi are quite different, but perhaps the algebraic presentation we give here, with terms and the semantic correctness criterion, is closer to Lambek's view.

"  We propose a high dimensional classification method that involves nonparametric feature augmentation. Knowing that marginal density ratios are the most powerful univariate classifiers, we use the ratio estimates to transform the original feature measurements. Subsequently, penalized logistic regression is invoked, taking as input the newly transformed or augmented features. This procedure trains models equipped with local complexity and global simplicity, thereby avoiding the curse of dimensionality while creating a flexible nonlinear decision boundary. The resulting method is called Feature Augmentation via Nonparametrics and Selection (FANS). We motivate FANS by generalizing the Naive Bayes model, writing the log ratio of joint densities as a linear combination of those of marginal densities. It is related to generalized additive models, but has better interpretability and computability. Risk bounds are developed for FANS. In numerical analysis, FANS is compared with competing methods, so as to provide a guideline on its best application domain. Real data analysis demonstrates that FANS performs very competitively on benchmark email spam and gene expression data sets. Moreover, FANS is implemented by an extremely fast algorithm through parallel computing. ",Feature Augmentation via Nonparametrics and Selection (FANS) in High   Dimensional Classification
"  An interacting Black-Scholes model for option pricing, where the usual constant interest rate r is replaced by a stochastic time dependent rate r(t) of the form r(t)=r+f(t) dW/dt, accounting for market imperfections and prices non-alignment, was developed in [1]. The white noise amplitude f(t), called arbitrage bubble, generates a time dependent potential U(t) which changes the usual equilibrium dynamics of the traditional Black-Scholes model. The purpose of this article is to tackle the inverse problem, that is, is it possible to extract the time dependent potential U(t) and its associated bubble shape f(t) from the real empirical financial data? In order to give an answer to this question, the interacting Black-Scholes equation must be interpreted as a quantum Schrodinger equation with hamiltonian operator H=H0+U(t), where H0 is the equilibrium Black-Scholes hamiltonian and U(t) is the interaction term. If the U(t) term is small enough, the interaction potential can be thought as a perturbation, so one can compute the solution of the interacting Black-Scholes equation in an approximate form by perturbation theory. In [2] by applying the semi-classical considerations, an approximate solution of the non equilibrium Black-Scholes equation for an arbitrary bubble shape f(t) was developed. Using this semi-classical solution and the knowledge about the mispricing of the financial data, one can determinate an equation, which solutions permit obtain the functional form of the potential term U(t) and its associated bubble f(t). In all the studied cases, the non equilibrium model performs a better estimation of the real data than the usual equilibrium model. It is expected that this new and simple methodology for calibrating and simulating option pricing solutions in the presence of market imperfections, could help to improve option pricing estimations.

"  The density of states of Dirac fermions with a random mass on a two-dimensional lattice is considered. We give the explicit asymptotic form of the single-electron density of states as a function of both energy and (average) Dirac mass, in the regime where all states are localized. We make use of a weak-disorder expansion in the parameter g/m^2, where g is the strength of disorder and m the average Dirac mass for the case in which the evaluation of the (supersymmetric) integrals corresponds to non-uniform solutions of the saddle point equation. The resulting density of states has tails which deviate from the typical pure Gaussian form by an analytic prefactor. ",Tails of Localized Density of States of Two-dimensional Dirac Fermions
"  Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of primordial star formation suggest that the gas within the first star-forming halos is turbulent. This has strong implications on the subsequent evolution, in particular on the generation of magnetic fields. Using high-resolution numerical simulations, we show that in the presence of turbulence, weak seed magnetic fields are exponentially amplified by the small-scale dynamo during the formation of the first stars. We conclude that strong magnetic fields are generated during the birth of the first stars in the universe, potentially modifying the mass distribution of these stars and influencing the subsequent cosmic evolution. We find that the presence of the small-scale turbulent dynamo can only be identified in numerical simulations in which the turbulent motions in the central core are resolved with at least 32 grid cells.

"  It is known that the Maxwell-Klein-Gordon system (M-K-G), when written relative to the Coulomb gauge, is globally well-posed for finite-energy initial data. This result, due to Klainerman and Machedon, relies crucially on the null structure of the main bilinear terms of M-K-G in Coulomb gauge. It appears to have been believed that such a structure is not present in Lorenz gauge, but we prove here that it is, and we use this fact to prove finite-energy global well-posedness in Lorenz gauge. The latter has the advantage, compared to Coulomb gauge, of being Lorentz invariant, hence M-K-G in Lorenz gauge is a system of nonlinear wave equations, whereas in Coulomb gauge the system has a less symmetric form, as it contains also a nonlinear elliptic equation.

"  We deal with the problem of determining the shape of an inclusion embedded in a homogenous background medium. The multifre-quency electrical impedance tomography is used to image the inclusion. For different frequencies, a current is injected at the boundary and the resulting potential is measured. It turns out that the potential solves an elliptic equation in divergence form with discontinuous leading coefficient. For this inverse problem we aim to establish a logarithmic type stability estimate. The key point in our analysis consists in reducing the original problem to that of determining an unknown part of the inner boundary from a single boundary measurment. The stability estimate is then used to prove uniqueness results. We also provide an expansion of the solution of the BVP under consideration in the eigenfunction basis of the Neumann-Poincar{\'e} operator associated to the Neumann-Green function.

Water is expected to freeze out at distances greater than 1-3 AU from solar-type central stars; more precise estimates are difficult to obtain due to uncertainties in the complex processes involved in disk evolution, including dust growth, settling, and radial drift, and the level of turbulence and viscous dissipation within disks. Interferometric observations are now providing constraints on the positions of CO snow lines, but extrapolation to the unresolved regions where water ice sublimates will require much better theoretical understanding of mass and angular momentum transport in disks as well as more refined comparison of observations with sophisticated disk models.

"  Diffusion probabilistic models have demonstrated an outstanding capability to model natural images and raw audio waveforms through a paired diffusion and reverse processes. The unique property of the reverse process (namely, eliminating non-target signals from the Gaussian noise and noisy signals) could be utilized to restore clean signals. Based on this property, we propose a diffusion probabilistic model-based speech enhancement (DiffuSE) model that aims to recover clean speech signals from noisy signals. The fundamental architecture of the proposed DiffuSE model is similar to that of DiffWave--a high-quality audio waveform generation model that has a relatively low computational cost and footprint. To attain better enhancement performance, we designed an advanced reverse process, termed the supportive reverse process, which adds noisy speech in each time-step to the predicted speech. The experimental results show that DiffuSE yields performance that is comparable to related audio generative models on the standardized Voice Bank corpus SE task. Moreover, relative to the generally suggested full sampling schedule, the proposed supportive reverse process especially improved the fast sampling, taking few steps to yield better enhancement results over the conventional full step inference process.

"  Recently, these has been a surge on studying how to obtain partially annotated data for model supervision. However, there still lacks a systematic study on how to train statistical models with partial annotation (PA). Taking dependency parsing as our case study, this paper describes and compares two straightforward approaches for three mainstream dependency parsers. The first approach is previously proposed to directly train a log-linear graph-based parser (LLGPar) with PA based on a forest-based objective. This work for the first time proposes the second approach to directly training a linear graph-based parse (LGPar) and a linear transition-based parser (LTPar) with PA based on the idea of constrained decoding. We conduct extensive experiments on Penn Treebank under three different settings for simulating PA, i.e., random dependencies, most uncertain dependencies, and dependencies with divergent outputs from the three parsers. The results show that LLGPar is most effective in learning from PA and LTPar lags behind the graph-based counterparts by large margin. Moreover, LGPar and LTPar can achieve best performance by using LLGPar to complete PA into full annotation (FA). ",Training Dependency Parsers with Partial Annotation

"  The thermoelectric properties of cubic zincblend silicon carbide nanowires (SiCNWs) with nitrogen impurities and vacancies along [111] direction are theoretically studied by means of atomistic simulations. It is found that the thermoelectric figure of merit ZT of SiCNWs can be significantly enhanced by doping N impurities together with making Si vacancies. Aiming at obtaining a large ZT, we study possible energetically stable configurations, and disclose that, when N dopants locate at the center, a small number of Si vacancies at corners are most favored for n-type nanowires, while a large number of Si vacancies spreading into the flat edge sites are most favored for p-type nanowires. For the SiCNW with a diameter of 1.1 nm and a length of 4.6 nm, the ZT value for the n-type is shown capable of reaching 1.78 at 900K.

"  We demonstrate that the confinement of half-quantized vortices (HQVs) in coherently coupled Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) simulates certain aspects of the confinement in $SU(2)$ quantum chromodynamics (QCD) in 2+1 space-time dimensions. By identifying the circulation of superfluid velocity as the baryon number and the relative phase between two components as a dual gluon, we identify HQVs in a single component as electrically charged particles with a half baryon number. Further, we show that only singlet states of the relative phase of two components can stably exist as bound states of vortices, that is, a pair of vortices in each component (a baryon) and a pair of a vortex and an antivortex in the same component (a meson). We then study the dynamics of a baryon and meson; baryon is static at the equilibrium and rotates once it deviates from the equilibrium, while a meson moves with constant velocity. For both baryon and meson we verify a linear confinement and determine that they are broken, thus creating other baryons or mesons in the middle when two constituent vortices are separated by more than some critical distance, resembling QCD.

  Helical spin textures in a $^{87}$Rb F=1 spinor Bose-Einstein condensate are found to decay spontaneously toward a spatially modulated structure of spin domains. This evolution is ascribed to magnetic dipolar interactions that energetically favor the short-wavelength domains over the long-wavelength spin helix. This is confirmed by eliminating the dipolar interactions by a sequence of rf pulses and observing a suppression of the formation of the short-range domains. This study confirms the significance of magnetic dipole interactions in degenerate $^{87}$Rb F=1 spinor gases. ,Spontaneously modulated spin textures in a dipolar spinor Bose-Einstein   condensate

The HPC AI benchmarks accelerate the process. Unfortunately, benchmarking HPC AI systems at scale raises serious challenges. This paper presents a representative, repeatable and simple HPC AI benchmarking methodology. Among the seventeen AI workloads of AIBench Training -- by far the most comprehensive AI Training benchmarks suite -- we choose two representative and repeatable AI workloads. The selected HPC AI benchmarks include both business and scientific computing: Image Classification and Extreme Weather Analytics. To rank HPC AI systems, we present a new metric named Valid FLOPS, emphasizing both throughput performance and a target quality. The specification, source code, datasets, and HPC AI500 ranking numbers are publicly available from \url{https://www.benchcouncil.org/HPCAI500/}.

"  Moist convective storms in Jupiter develop frequently and can trigger atmospheric activity of different scales, from localized storms to planetary-scale disturbances including convective activity confined inside a larger meteorological system. In February 2018 a series of convective storms erupted in Jupiter's South Temperate Belt (STB) (planetocentric latitudes from -23$^{\circ}$ to -29.5$^{\circ}$). This occurred inside an elongated cyclonic region known popularly as the STB Ghost, close to the large anticyclone Oval BA, resulting in the clouds from the storms being confined to the cyclone. The initial storms lasted only a few days but they generated abundant enduring turbulence. They also produced dark features, possibly partially devoid of clouds, that circulated around the cyclone over the first week. The subsequent activity developed over months and resulted in two main structures, one of them closely interacting with Oval BA and the other one being expelled to the west. Here we present a study of this meteorological activity based on daily observations provided by the amateur community, complemented by observations obtained from PlanetCam UPV/EHU at Calar Alto Observatory, the Hubble Space Telescope and by JunoCam on the Juno spacecraft. We also perform numerical simulations with the EPIC General Circulation Model to reproduce the phenomenology observed. The successful simulations require a complex interplay between the Ghost, the convective eruptions and Oval BA, and they demonstrate that water moist convection was the source of the initial storms. A simple scale comparison with other moist convective storms that can be observed in the planet in visible and methane absorption band images strongly suggests that most of these storms are powered by water condensation instead of ammonia.

"  Aims: We evaluate the radial velocity (RV) information content and achievable precision on M0-M9 spectra covering the ZYJHK bands. We do so while considering both a perfect atmospheric transmission correction and discarding areas polluted by deep telluric features, as done in previous works.   Methods: To simulate the M-dwarf spectra, PHOENIX-ACES model spectra were employed; they were convolved with rotational kernels and instrumental profiles to reproduce stars with a $v.sin{i}$ of 1.0, 5.0, and 10.0 km/s when observed at resolutions of 60 000, 80 000, and 100 000. We considered the RV precision as calculated on the whole spectra, after discarding strongly polluted areas, and after applying a perfect telluric correction. In our simulations we paid particular attention to the details of the convolution and sampling of the spectra, and we discuss their impact on the final spectra.   Results: Our simulations show that the most important parameter ruling the difference in attainable precision between the considered bands is the spectral type. For M0-M3 stars, the bands that deliver the most precise RV measurements are the Z, Y, and H band, with relative merits depending on the parameters of the simulation. For M6-M9 stars, the bands show a difference in precision that is within a factor of $\sim$2 and does not clearly depend on the band; this difference is reduced to a factor smaller than $\sim$1.5 if we consider a non-rotating star seen at high resolution. We also show that an M6-M9 spectrum will deliver a precision about two times better as an M0-M3 spectra with the same signal-to-noise ratio. Finally, we note that the details of modelling the Earth atmosphere and interpreting the results have a significant impact on which wavelength regions are discarded when setting a limit threshold at 2-3%.

"  We propose a model for explanation the ""domain-wall"" type configuration states in binary lipid mixtures of cationic and neutral lipids, associated with observed relaxation effects in their aggregates. We apply the analogy with formation of Kibble-\.Zurek topological defects, which we suppose connected with structural dynamics of the lipid phases. In frames of the proposed model, the density of kink-type defects and the energy of the configurations are calculated. ",Phase heterogeneities of lipidic aggregates
"  Collisions of two fermionic dimers near the unitary limit are studied using exact four-particle equations for transition operators in momentum space. Universal properties of dimer-dimer phase shifts and effective range expansion (ERE) parameters are determined. The inclusion of the fourth-order momentum term in the ERE significantly extends its validity to higher collision energies. The dimer-dimer scattering length and effective range are determined in the unitary limit as well as their corrections arising due to the finite range of the two-fermion interaction. These results are of considerably higher accuracy as compared to previous works, but confirm most of the previous results except for the lattice effective field theory calculations.

"  Exoplanet surveys have confirmed one of humanity's (and all teenagers') worst fears: we are weird. If our Solar System were observed with present-day Earth technology -- to put our system and exoplanets on the same footing -- Jupiter is the only planet that would be detectable. The statistics of exo-Jupiters indicate that the Solar System is unusual at the ~1% level among Sun-like stars (or ~0.1% among all stars). But why are we different?   Successful formation models for both the Solar System and exoplanet systems rely on two key processes: orbital migration and dynamical instability. Systems of close-in super-Earths or sub-Neptunes require substantial radial inward motion of solids either as drifting mm- to cm-sized pebbles or migrating Earth-mass or larger planetary embryos. We argue that, regardless of their formation mode, the late evolution of super-Earth systems involves migration into chains of mean motion resonances, generally followed by instability when the disk dissipates. This pattern is likely also ubiquitous in giant planet systems. We present three models for inner Solar System formation -- the low-mass asteroid belt, Grand Tack, and Early Instability models -- each invoking a combination of migration and instability.   We identify bifurcation points in planetary system formation. We present a series of events to explain why our Solar System is so weird. Jupiter's core must have formed fast enough to quench the growth of Earth's building blocks by blocking the flux of inward-drifting pebbles. The large Jupiter/Saturn mass ratio is rare among giant exoplanets but may be required to maintain Jupiter's wide orbit. The giant planets' instability must have been gentle, with no close encounters between Jupiter and Saturn, also unusual in the larger (exoplanet) context. Our Solar System system is thus the outcome of multiple unusual, but not unheard of, events. ",Solar System Formation in the Context of Extra-Solar Planets
"  Purpose: Previously-developed Voxel Spread Function (VSF) method (Yablonskiy, et al, MRM, 2013;70:1283) provides means to correct artifacts induced by macroscopic magnetic field inhomogeneities in the images obtained by multi-Gradient-Recalled-Echo (mGRE) techniques. The goal of this study is to develop a library-driven approach for fast VSF implementation. Methods: The VSF approach describes the contribution of the magnetic field inhomogeneity effects on the mGRE signal decay in terms of the F-function calculated from mGRE phase and magnitude images. A pre-calculated library accounting for a variety of background field gradients caused by magnetic field inhomogeneities was used herein to speed up calculation of the F-function and to generate quantitative R2* maps from the mGRE data collected from two healthy volunteers. Results: As compared with direct calculation of the F-function based on a voxel-wise approach, the new library-driven method substantially reduces computational time from several hours to few minutes, while, at the same time, providing similar accuracy of R2* mapping. Conclusion: The new procedure proposed in this study provides a fast post-processing algorithm that can be incorporated in the quantitative analysis of mGRE data to account for background field inhomogeneity artifacts, thus can facilitate the applications of mGRE-based quantitative techniques in clinical practices.

In particular, E/S0 lens galaxies are studied by combining gravitational lensing, photometric and kinematic data obtained with ground-based (VLA/Keck/VLT) and space-based telescopes (HST). Here, we report on preliminary results from the LSD Survey, in particular on (i) the constraints set on the luminous and dark-matter distributions in the inner several R_eff of E/S0 galaxies, (ii) the evolution of their stellar component and (iii) the constraints set on the value of H_0 from time-delay systems by combining lensing and kinematic data to break degeneracies in gravitational-lens models.

"  In recommender systems and advertising platforms, marketers always want to deliver products, contents, or advertisements to potential audiences over media channels such as display, video, or social. Given a set of audiences or customers (seed users), the audience expansion technique (look-alike modeling) is a promising solution to identify more potential audiences, who are similar to the seed users and likely to finish the business goal of the target campaign. However, look-alike modeling faces two challenges: (1) In practice, a company could run hundreds of marketing campaigns to promote various contents within completely different categories every day, e.g., sports, politics, society. Thus, it is difficult to utilize a common method to expand audiences for all campaigns. (2) The seed set of a certain campaign could only cover limited users. Therefore, a customized approach based on such a seed set is likely to be overfitting.   In this paper, to address these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage framework named Meta Hybrid Experts and Critics (MetaHeac) which has been deployed in WeChat Look-alike System. In the offline stage, a general model which can capture the relationships among various tasks is trained from a meta-learning perspective on all existing campaign tasks. In the online stage, for a new campaign, a customized model is learned with the given seed set based on the general model. According to both offline and online experiments, the proposed MetaHeac shows superior effectiveness for both content marketing campaigns in recommender systems and advertising campaigns in advertising platforms. Besides, MetaHeac has been successfully deployed in WeChat for the promotion of both contents and advertisements, leading to great improvement in the quality of marketing.

"  We appreciate the effort by Schwarzkopf to examine alternative explanations for predictive anticipatory activity (PAA) or presentiment (for first response, see: Schwarzkopf 2014a; for additional response, see: Schwarzkopf 2014b, for original article, see: Mossbridge et al. 2014). These commentaries are a laudable effort to promote collegial discussion of the controversial claim of presentiment, whereby physiological measures preceding unpredictable emotional events differ from physiological measures preceding calm or neutral events (Mossbridge et al., 2012; Mossbridge et al., 2014). What is called truth at any given time in science has achieved that status through a continuous process of measurement and interpretation based on the current knowledge at hand. Here we address six points in his original commentary (Schwarzkopf 2014a), though our responses are informed by the points he made in his his supplementary commentary (Schwarzkopf 2014b).

"  We consider a general two-Higgs-doublet model with CP violation in the scalar sector. Three neutral Higgs fields of the model all mix and the resulting physical Higgs bosons have no definite CP properties. That leads, at the one-loop level of the perturbation expansion, to CP-violating form factors for gamma-t-tbar, Z-t-tbar and W-t-b interaction vertices. We discuss asymmetries sensitive to CP violation induced by the form factors for the process e^+ e^- -> t tbar -> l^\pm ... and e^+ e^- -> t tbar -> b/bbar ... at future linear e+ e- colliders.

  Coexistence of antiferromagnetism and d-wave superconductivity within a CuO_2 plane was recently observed in a wide doping region for multilayer high-temperature cuprate superconductors. We find that the experimental phase diagram is well reproduced in the slave-boson mean-field scheme of the two-dimensional t-J model by including antiferromagnetic order. We argue that weak three dimensionality coming from a multilayer structure is sufficient to stabilize antiferromagnetic order and its coexistence with superconductivity. ,Multilayer cuprate superconductors as possible systems described by   resonating-valence-bond and antiferromagnetic orders
"  A spontaneously active neural system that is capable of continual learning should also be capable of homeostasis of both firing rate and connectivity. Experimental evidence suggests that both types of homeostasis exist, and that connectivity is maintained at a state that is optimal for information transmission and storage. This state is referred to as the critical state. We present a simple stochastic computational Hebbian learning model that incorporates both firing rate and critical homeostasis, and we explore its stability and connectivity properties. We also examine the behavior of our model with a simulated seizure and with simulated acute deafferentation. We argue that a neural system that is more highly connected than the critical state (i.e., one that is ""supercritical"") is epileptogenic. Based on our simulations, we predict that the post-seizural and post-deafferentation states should be supercritical and epileptogenic. Furthermore, interventions that boost spontaneous activity should be protective against epileptogenesis.

"  We study various aspects of proximity effects in $F/S$ (Ferromagnet/Superconductor) bilayers, where $F$ has a spiral magnetic texture such as that found in Holmium, Erbium and other materials, and $S$ is a conventional s-wave superconductor. We numerically solve the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) equations self-consistently and use the solutions to compute quantities relevant to the proximity effects in these bilayers. We obtain the relation between the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ and the thicknesses $d_F$ of the magnetic layer by solving the linearized BdG equations. We find that the $T_c(d_F)$ curves include multiple oscillations. Moreover, the system may be reentrant not only with $d_F$, as is the case when the magnet is uniform, but with temperature $T$: the superconductivity disappears in certain ranges of $d_F$ or $T$. The $T$ reentrance occurs when $d_F$ is larger than the spatial period of the conical exchange field. We compute the condensation free energies and entropies from the full BdG equations and find the results are in agreement with $T_c$ values obtained by linearization. The inhomogeneous nature of the magnet makes it possible for all odd triplet pairing components to be induced. We have investigated their properties and found that, as compared to the singlet amplitude, both the $m=0$ and $m=\pm 1$ triplet components exhibit long range penetration. For nanoscale bilayers, the proximity lengths for both layers are also obtained. These lengths oscillate with $d_F$ and they are found to be long range on both sides. These results are shown to be consistent with recent experiments. We also calculate the reverse proximity effect described by the three dimensional local magnetization, and the local DOS, which reveals important energy resolved signatures associated with the proximity effects.

"  Using the model based on the Regge-like laws, new analytical formulas are obtained for the moment of inertia, the rotation frequency, and the radius of astronomical non-exotic objects (planets, stars, galaxies, and clusters of galaxies). The rotation frequency and moment of inertia of neutron star and the observable Universe are estimated.

"  The astrophysical p process, which is responsible for the origin of the proton rich stable nuclei heavier than iron, was investigated using a full nuclear reaction network for a type II supernova explosion when the shock front passes through the O/Ne layer. Calculations were performed with a multi-layer model adopting the seed of a pre-explosion evolution of a 25 solar mass star. The reaction flux was calculated to determine the main reaction path and branching points responsible for synthesizing the proton rich nuclei. In order to investigate the impact of nuclear reaction rates on the predicted p-process abundances, extensive simulations with different sets of collectively and individually modified neutron-, proton-, alpha-capture and photodisintegration rates have been performed. These results are not only relevant to explore the nuclear physics related uncertainties in p-process calculations but are also important for identifying the strategy and planning of future experiments.

"  Energy-efficient signal processing systems require estimation methods operating on data collected with low-complexity devices. Using analog-to-digital converters (ADC) with $1$-bit amplitude resolution has been identified as a possible option in order to obtain low power consumption. The $1$-bit performance loss, in comparison to an ideal receiver with $\infty$-bit ADC, is well-established and moderate for low SNR applications ($2/\pi$ or $-1.96$ dB). Recently it has been shown that for parameter estimation with state-space models the $1$-bit performance loss with Bayesian filtering can be significantly smaller ($\sqrt{2/\pi}$ or $-0.98$ dB). Here we extend the analysis to Bayesian smoothing where additional measurements are used to reconstruct the current state of the system parameter. Our results show that a $1$-bit receiver performing smoothing is able to outperform an ideal $\infty$-bit system carrying out filtering by the cost of an additional processing delay $\Delta$. ",Asymptotic Performance Analysis for 1-bit Bayesian Smoothing
"  We present the results of an ensemble of simulations of the collapse and fragmentation of dense star-forming cores. We show that even with very low levels of turbulence the outcome is usually a binary, or higher-order multiple, system. We take as the initial conditions for these simulations a typical low-mass core, based on the average properties of a large sample of observed cores. All the simulated cores start with a mass of $M = 5.4 M_{\odot}$, a flattened central density profile, a ratio of thermal to gravitational energy $\alpha_{\rm therm} = 0.45$ and a ratio of turbulent to gravitational energy $\alpha_{\rm turb} = 0.05 $. Even this low level of turbulence is sufficient to produce multiple star formation in 80% of the cores; the mean number of stars and brown dwarfs formed from a single core is 4.55, and the maximum is 10. At the outset, the cores have no large-scale rotation. The only difference between each individual simulation is the detailed structure of the turbulent velocity field. The multiple systems formed in the simulations have properties consistent with observed multiple systems. Dynamical evolution tends preferentially to eject lower mass stars and brown dwarves whilst hardening the remaining binaries so that the median semi-major axis of binaries formed is $\sim 30$ au. Ejected objects are usually single low-mass stars and brown dwarfs, yielding a strong correlation between mass and multiplicity. Our simulations suggest a natural mechanism for forming binary stars that does not require large-scale rotation, capture, or large amounts of turbulence.

"  We have experimentally studied the pump-probe Kerr rotation dynamics in WSe$_2$ monolayers. This yields a direct measurement of the exciton valley depolarization time $\tau_v$. At T=4K, we find $\tau_v\approx 6$ps, a fast relaxation time resulting from the strong electron-hole Coulomb exchange interaction in bright excitons. The exciton valley depolarization time decreases significantly when the lattice temperature increases with $\tau_v$ being as short as 1.5ps at 125K. The temperature dependence is well explained by the developed theory taking into account the exchange interaction and a fast exciton scattering time on short-range potentials.

"  For any knot $K$ which bounds non-orientable and null-homologous surfaces $F$ in punctured $n\mathbb{C}P^2$, we construct a lower bound of the first Betti number of $F$ which consists of the signature of $K$ and the Heegaard Floer $d$-invariant of the integer homology sphere obtained by $1$-surgery along $K$. By using this lower bound, we prove that for any integer $k$, a certain knot cannot bound any surface which satisfies the above conditions and whose first Betti number is less than $k$.

"  Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) has been widely used in state estimation and parameter estimation for the dynamic system where observational data is obtained sequentially in time.   To reduce uncertainty and accelerate posterior inference, a two-stage ensemble Kalman filter is presented to improve the sequential analysis of EnKF. It is known that the final posterior ensemble may be concentrated in a small portion of the entire support of the initial prior ensemble. It will be much more efficient if we first build a new prior by some partial observations, and construct a surrogate only over the significant region of the new prior. To this end, we construct a very coarse model using generalized multiscale finite element method (GMsFEM) and generate a new prior ensemble in the first stage. GMsFEM provides a set of hierarchical multiscale basis functions supported in coarse blocks. This gives flexibility and adaptivity to choosing degree of freedoms to construct a reduce model. In the second stage, we build an initial surrogate model based on the new prior by using GMsFEM and sparse generalized polynomial chaos (gPC)-based stochastic collocation methods. To improve the initial surrogate model, we dynamically update the surrogate model, which is adapted to the sequential availability of data and the updated analysis. The two-stage EnKF can achieve a better estimation than standard EnKF, and significantly improve the efficiency to update the ensemble analysis (posterior exploration). To enhance the applicability and flexibility in Bayesian inverse problems, we extend the two-stage EnKF to non-Gaussian models and hierarchical models. In the paper, we focus on the time fractional diffusion-wave models in porous media and investigate their Bayesian inverse problems using the proposed two-stage EnKF.

"  The field identification problem, including fixed point resolution, is solved for the non-hermitian symmetric $N=2$ superconformal coset theories. Thereby these models are finally identified as well-defined modular invariant CFTs. As an application, the theories are used as subtheories in tensor products with $c=9$, which in turn are taken as the inner sector of heterotic superstring compactifications. All string theories of this type are classified, and the chiral ring as well as the number of massless generations and anti-generations are computed with the help of the extended Poincare polynomial. Several equivalences between a priori different non-hermitian cosets show up; in particular there is a level-rank duality for an infinite series based on $C$ type Lie algebras. Further, some general results for generic $N=2$ cosets are proven: a simple formula for the number of identification currents is found, and it is shown that the set of Ramond ground states of any $N=2$ coset model is invariant under charge conjugation.

"  In this paper, we investigate the impact of T_{ox} and Vth on power performance trade-offs for on-chip caches. We start by examining the optimization of the various components of a single level cache and then extend this to two level cache systems. In addition to leakage, our studies also account for the dynamic power expanded as a result of cache misses. Our results show that one can often reduce overall power by increasing the size of the L2 cache if we only allow one pair of Vth/T_{ox} in L2. However, if we allow the memory cells and the peripherals to have their own Vth's and T_{ox}'s, we show that a two-level cache system with smaller L2's will yield less total leakage. We further show that two Vth's and two T_{ox}'s are sufficient to get close to an optimal solution, and that Vth is generally a better design knob than T_{ox} for leakage optimization, thus it is better to restrict the number of T_{ox}'s rather than Vth's if cost is a concern.

"  The most common assumption in evolutionary game theory is that players should adopt a strategy that warrants the highest payoff. However, recent studies indicate that the spatial selection for cooperation is enhanced if an appropriate fraction of the population chooses the most common rather than the most profitable strategy within the interaction range. Such conformity might be due to herding instincts or crowd behavior in humans and social animals. In a heterogeneous population where individuals differ in their degree, collective influence, or other traits, an unanswered question remains who should conform. Selecting conformists randomly is the simplest choice, but it is neither a realistic nor the optimal one. We show that, regardless of the source of heterogeneity and game parametrization, socially the most favorable outcomes emerge if the masses conform. On the other hand, forcing leaders to conform significantly hinders the constructive interplay between heterogeneity and coordination, leading to evolutionary outcomes that are worse still than if conformists were chosen randomly. We conclude that leaders must be able to create a following for network reciprocity to be optimally augmented by conformity. In the opposite case, when leaders are castrated and made to follow, the failure of coordination impairs the evolution of cooperation. ",Leaders should not be conformists in evolutionary social dilemmas
"  Accurate modeling of the solvent environment for biological molecules is crucial for computational biology and drug design. A popular approach to achieve long simulation time scales for large system sizes is to incorporate the effect of the solvent in a mean-field fashion with implicit solvent models. However, a challenge with existing implicit solvent models is that they often lack accuracy or certain physical properties compared to explicit solvent models, as the many-body effects of the neglected solvent molecules is difficult to model as a mean field. Here, we leverage machine learning (ML) and multi-scale coarse graining (CG) in order to learn implicit solvent models that can approximate the energetic and thermodynamic properties of a given explicit solvent model with arbitrary accuracy, given enough training data. Following the previous ML--CG models CGnet and CGSchnet, we introduce ISSNet, a graph neural network, to model the implicit solvent potential of mean force. ISSNet can learn from explicit solvent simulation data and be readily applied to MD simulations. We compare the solute conformational distributions under different solvation treatments for two peptide systems. The results indicate that ISSNet models can outperform widely-used generalized Born and surface area models in reproducing the thermodynamics of small protein systems with respect to explicit solvent. The success of this novel method demonstrates the potential benefit of applying machine learning methods in accurate modeling of solvent effects for in silico research and biomedical applications.

"  Willems' fundamental lemma asserts that all trajectories of a linear time-invariant system can be obtained from a finite number of measured ones, assuming that controllability and a persistency of excitation condition hold. We show that these two conditions can be relaxed. First, we prove that the controllability condition can be replaced by a condition on the controllable subspace, unobservable subspace, and a certain subspace associated with the measured trajectories. Second, we prove that the persistency of excitation requirement can be relaxed if the degree of a certain minimal polynomial is tightly bounded. Our results show that data-driven predictive control using online data is equivalent to model predictive control, even for uncontrollable systems. Moreover, our results significantly reduce the amount of data needed in identifying homogeneous multi-agent systems.

"  The fast radio bursts (FRBs) 110220 and 140514 were detected at telescope pointing locations within 9 arcmin of each other over three years apart, both within the same 14.4 arcmin beam of the Parkes radio telescope. Nevertheless, they generally have not been considered to be from the same source because of a vastly different dispersion measure (DM) for the two bursts by over $380\,{\rm pc\,cm^{-3}}$. Here we consider the hypothesis that these two FRBs are from the same neutron star embedded within a supernova remnant (SNR) that provides an evolving DM as the ejecta expands and becomes more diffuse. Using such a model and the observed DM change, it can be argued that the corresponding SN must have occurred within $\approx10.2$ years of FRB 110220. Furthermore, constraints can be placed on the SN ejecta mass and explosion energy, which appear to require a stripped envelope (Type Ib/c) SN and/or a very energetic explosion. A third FRB from this location would be even more constraining, allowing the component of the DM due to the SNR to be separated from the unchanging DM components due to the host galaxy and intergalactic medium. In the future, if more FRBs are found to repeat, the sort of arguments presented here can be used to test the young neutron star progenitor hypothesis for FRBs.

"  The presence of groups containing high leverage outliers makes linear regression a difficult problem due to the masking effect. The available high breakdown estimators based on Least Trimmed Squares often do not succeed in detecting masked high leverage outliers in finite samples.   An alternative to the LTS estimator, called Penalised Trimmed Squares (PTS) estimator, was introduced by the authors in \cite{ZiouAv:05,ZiAvPi:07} and it appears to be less sensitive to the masking problem. This estimator is defined by a Quadratic Mixed Integer Programming (QMIP) problem, where in the objective function a penalty cost for each observation is included which serves as an upper bound on the residual error for any feasible regression line. Since the PTS does not require presetting the number of outliers to delete from the data set, it has better efficiency with respect to other estimators. However, due to the high computational complexity of the resulting QMIP problem, exact solutions for moderately large regression problems is infeasible.   In this paper we further establish the theoretical properties of the PTS estimator, such as high breakdown and efficiency, and propose an approximate algorithm called Fast-PTS to compute the PTS estimator for large data sets efficiently. Extensive computational experiments on sets of benchmark instances with varying degrees of outlier contamination, indicate that the proposed algorithm performs well in identifying groups of high leverage outliers in reasonable computational time.

"  With the development of condensed-matter physics and nanotechnology, attention has turned to the fields near and on surfaces that result from interactions between electric dipole radiation and mesoscale structures. It is hoped that studying these fields will further our understanding of optical phenomena in nano-optics, quantum mechanics, electromagnetics and sensing using solid-state photon emitters. Here, we describe a method for implementing dynamic electric and magnetic dipoles in the frequency domain into a non-singular field-only surface method. We show that the effect of dipoles can conveniently be described as a relatively simple term in the integral equations, which fully represents how they drive the fields and interactions. Also, due to the non-singularity, our method can calculate the electric and magnetic fields on the surfaces of objects in both near and far fields with the same accuracy, which makes it an ideal tool to investigate nano-optical phenomena. The derivation of the framework is given and tested against a Mie theory alike formula. Some interesting examples are shown involving the interaction of dipoles with different types of mesoscale structures including parabolic nano-antenna and gold probes.

"  Using the data collected by the four experiments at LEP during 1990-1994, a precise measurement of the tau longitudinal polarisation (P_tau) has been performed, as well as the measurement of the transverse-transverse and transverse-normal tau spin correlations. From the P_tau measurement, assuming lepton universality of the neutral currents, the effective weak mixing angle has been determined to be sin(theta_W) = 0.2325 +- 0.0006. The Standard Model predictions are consistent with the measured results. ",Spin Analysis of the Process e+e- --> tau+tau- at LEP
"  The recently discovered protostellar jet known as HH212 is beautifully symmetric, with a series of paired shock knots and bow shocks on either side of the exciting source region, IRAS 05413-0104 (Zinnecker et al. 1998). We present VLA ammonia maps of the IRAS 05413-0104 molecular gas envelope in which the protostellar jet source is embedded. We find that the envelope, with mass of 0.2 M(sun) detected by the interferometer, is flattened perpendicular to the jet axis with a FWHM diameter of 12000 AU and an axis ratio of 2:1, as seen in NH3 (1,1) emission. There is a velocity gradient of about 4-5 km sec^-1 pc^-1 across the flattened disk-like core, suggestive of rotation around an axis aligned with the jet. Flux-weighted mean velocities increase smoothly with radius with a roughly constant velocity gradient. In young (Class 0) systems such as HH212, a significant amount of material is still distributed in a large surrounding envelope, and thus the observable kinematics of the system may reflect the less centrally condensed, youthful state of the source and obscuration of central dynamics. The angular momentum of this envelope material may be released from infalling gas through rotation in the HH212 jet, as recent observations suggest (Davis et al. 2000). A blue-shifted wisp or bowl of emitting gas appears to be swept up along the blue side of the outflow, possibly lining the cavity of a wider angle wind around the more collimated shock jet axis. Our ammonia (2,2)/(1,1) ratio map indicates that this very cold core is heated to 14 Kelvin degrees in a centrally condensed area surrounding the jet source. This edge-on core and jet system appears to be young and deeply embedded. This environment, however, is apparently not disrupting the pristine symmetry and collimation of the jet.

"  It has been long suspected that spin fluctuations in the weak itinerant ferromagnet ZrZn2 may lead to a triplet superconductivity in this material. Here we point out another possibility, a spatially inhomogeneous singlet superconducting state (a Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state). We report detailed electronic structure calculations, as well as calculations of the zone center phonons and their coupling with electrons. We find that the exchange splitting is nonuniform and may allow for gap formation at some parts of the Fermi surface. We also find that there is substantial coupling of Zr rattling modes with electrons, which can, in principle, provide the necessary pairing in the s-channel.

"  A central challenge in Gravitational Wave Astronomy is identifying weak signals in the presence of non-stationary and non-Gaussian noise. The separation of gravitational wave signals from noise requires good models for both. When accurate signal models are available, such as for binary Neutron star systems, it is possible to make robust detection statements even when the noise is poorly understood. In contrast, searches for ""un-modeled"" transient signals are strongly impacted by the methods used to characterize the noise. Here we take a Bayesian approach and introduce a multi-component, variable dimension, parameterized noise model that explicitly accounts for non-stationarity and non-Gaussianity in data from interferometric gravitational wave detectors. Instrumental transients (glitches) and burst sources of gravitational waves are modeled using a Morlet-Gabor continuous wavelet frame. The number and placement of the wavelets is determined by a trans-dimensional Reversible Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm. The Gaussian component of the noise and sharp line features in the noise spectrum are modeled using the BayesLine algorithm, which operates in concert with the wavelet model.

"  Delivering hands-on practice laboratories for introductory courses on operating systems is a difficult task. One of the main sources of the difficulty is the sheer size and complexity of the operating systems software. Consequently, some of the solutions adopted in the literature to teach operating systems laboratory consider smaller and simpler systems, generally referred to as instructional operating systems. This work continues in the same direction and is threefold. First, it considers a simpler hardware platform. Second, it argues that a minimal operating system is a viable option for delivering laboratories. Third, it presents a laboratory teaching platform, whereby students build a minimal operating system for an embedded hardware platform. The proposed platform is called MiniOS. An important aspect of MiniOS is that it is sufficiently supported with additional technical and pedagogic material. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach to teach operating systems laboratories is illustrated through the experience of using it to deliver laboratory projects in the Operating Systems course at the University of Northern British Columbia. Finally, we discuss experimental research in computing education and considered the qualitative results of this work as part of a larger research endeavour.

"  We study the hardness of the dihedral hidden subgroup problem. It is known that lattice problems reduce to it, and that it reduces to random subset sum with density $> 1$ and also to quantum sampling subset sum solutions. We examine a decision version of the problem where the question asks whether the hidden subgroup is trivial or order two. The decision problem essentially asks if a given vector is in the span of all coset states. We approach this by first computing an explicit basis for the coset space and the perpendicular space. We then look at the consequences of having efficient unitaries that use this basis. We show that if a unitary maps the basis to the standard basis in any way, then that unitary can be used to solve random subset sum with constant density $>1$. We also show that if a unitary can exactly decide membership in the coset subspace, then the collision problem for subset sum can be solved for density $>1$ but approaching $1$ as the problem size increases. This strengthens the previous hardness result that implementing the optimal POVM in a specific way is as hard as quantum sampling subset sum solutions.

"  We determine the low-redshift field galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) using an area of 143 deg^2 from the first three years of the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey. The magnitude limits of this redshift survey are r < 19.4 mag over two thirds and 19.8 mag over one third of the area. The GSMF is determined from a sample of 5210 galaxies using a density-corrected maximum volume method. This efficiently overcomes the issue of fluctuations in the number density versus redshift. With H_0 = 70, the GSMF is well described between 10^8 and 10^11.5 Msun using a double Schechter function with mass^* = 10^10.66 Msun, phi_1^* = 3.96 x 10^-3 Mpc^-3, alpha_1 = -0.35, phi_2^* = 0.79 x 10^-3 Mpc^-3 and alpha_2 = -1.47. This result is more robust to uncertainties in the flow-model corrected redshifts than from the shallower Sloan Digital Sky Survey main sample (r < 17.8 mag). The upturn in the GSMF is also seen directly in the i-band and K-band galaxy luminosity functions. Accurately measuring the GSMF below 10^8 Msun is possible within the GAMA survey volume but as expected requires deeper imaging data to address the contribution from low surface-brightness galaxies.

"  The interplay between topology and correlations can generate a variety of unusual quantum phases, many of which remain to be explored. Recent advances have identified monolayer WTe2 as a promising material for exploring such interplay in a highly tunable fashion. The ground state of this two-dimensional (2D) crystal can be electrostatically tuned from a quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI) to a superconductor. However, much remains unknown about the nature of these ground states, including the gap-opening mechanism of the insulating state. Here we report systematic studies of the insulating phase in WTe2 monolayer and uncover evidence supporting that the QSHI is also an excitonic insulator (EI). An EI, arising from the spontaneous formation of electron-hole bound states (excitons), is a largely unexplored quantum phase to date, especially when it is topological. Our experiments on high-quality transport devices reveal the presence of an intrinsic insulating state at the charge neutrality point (CNP) in clean samples. The state exhibits both a strong sensitivity to the electric displacement field and a Hall anomaly that are consistent with the excitonic pairing. We further confirm the correlated nature of this charge-neutral insulator by tunneling spectroscopy. Our results support the existence of an EI phase in the clean limit and rule out alternative scenarios of a band insulator or a localized insulator. These observations lay the foundation for understanding a new class of correlated insulators with nontrivial topology and identify monolayer WTe2 as a promising candidate for exploring quantum phases of ground-state excitons.

"  We study some properties of A^1-homotopy groups: geometric interpretations of connectivity, excision results, and a re-interpretation of quotients by free actions of connected solvable groups in terms of covering spaces in the sense of A^1-homotopy theory. These concepts and results are well-suited to the study of certain quotients via geometric invariant theory.   As a case study in the geometry of solvable group quotients, we investigate A^1-homotopy groups of smooth toric varieties. We give simple combinatorial conditions (in terms of fans) guaranteeing vanishing of low degree A^1-homotopy groups of smooth (proper) toric varieties. Finally, in certain cases, we can actually compute the ""next"" non-vanishing A^1-homotopy group (beyond \pi_1^{A^1}) of a smooth toric variety. From this point of view, A^1-homotopy theory, even with its exquisite sensitivity to algebro-geometric structure, is almost ""as tractable"" (in low degrees) as ordinary homotopy for large classes of interesting varieties.

"  We uncover a novel mechanism for superscattering of subwavelength resonators closely associated with the physics of bound states in the continuum. We demonstrate that superscattering occurs as a consequence of constructive interference driven by the Friedrich-Wintgen mechanism, and it may exceed the currently established limits for the cross-section of a single open scattering channel, within the channel itself. We develop a non-Hermitian model to describe interfering resonances of quasi-normal modes to show that this effect can only occur for scatterers violating the spherical symmetry, and therefore it cannot be predicted with the classical Mie solutions. Our results reveal unusual physics of non-Hermitian systems having important implications for functional metadevices. ",Superscattering Empowered by Bound States in the Continuum
"  Muon beam monitoring is indispensable for indirectly monitoring accelerator-produced neutrino beams in real time. Though Si photodiodes and ionization chambers have been successfully used as muon monitors at the T2K experiment, sensors that are more radiation tolerant are desired for future operation. We have investigated the electron-multiplier tube (EMT) as a new sensor for muon monitoring. Secondary electrons produced by the passage of muons at dynodes are multiplied in the tube and produce signal. Two prototype detectors were installed at the T2K muon monitor location, and various EMT properties were studied based on in situ data taken with the T2K muon beam. The signal size is as expected based on calculation, and the EMTs show a sufficiently fast time response for bunch-by-bunch beam monitoring. The spill-by-spill intensity resolution is 0.4%, better than the required value (1%). Signal linearity within $\pm$1% is achieved at proton beam powers up to 460 kW (with +250 kA focusing horn operation). A gradual signal decrease was observed during the initial exposure, due to the stabilization of dynode materials, before the response became stable within $\pm$1%. This work demonstrates that EMTs are a good candidate for future muon monitoring at T2K, and may also have other more general applications.

"  The outbreak of COVID-19 has resulted in an ""infodemic"" that has encouraged the propagation of misinformation about COVID-19 and cure methods which, in turn, could negatively affect the adoption of recommended public health measures in the larger population. In this paper, we provide a new multimodal (consisting of images, text and temporal information) labeled dataset containing news articles and tweets on the COVID-19 vaccine. We collected 2,593 news articles from 80 publishers for one year between Feb 16th 2020 to May 8th 2021 and 24184 Twitter posts (collected between April 17th 2021 to May 8th 2021). We combine ratings from two news media ranking sites: Medias Bias Chart and Media Bias/Fact Check (MBFC) to classify the news dataset into two levels of credibility: reliable and unreliable. The combination of two filters allows for higher precision of labeling. We also propose a stance detection mechanism to annotate tweets into three levels of credibility: reliable, unreliable and inconclusive. We provide several statistics as well as other analytics like, publisher distribution, publication date distribution, topic analysis, etc. We also provide a novel architecture that classifies the news data into misinformation or truth to provide a baseline performance for this dataset. We find that the proposed architecture has an F-Score of 0.919 and accuracy of 0.882 for fake news detection. Furthermore, we provide benchmark performance for misinformation detection on tweet dataset.

"  We study existence, uniqueness and regularity of solutions for linear equations in infinitely many derivatives. We develop a natural framework based on Laplace transform as a correspondence between appropriate $L^p$ and Hardy spaces: this point of view allows us to interpret rigorously operators of the form $f(\partial_t)$ where $f$ is an analytic function such as (the analytic continuation of) the Riemann zeta function. We find the most general solution to the equation \begin{equation*} f(\partial_t) \phi = J(t) \; , \; \; \; t \geq 0 \; , \end{equation*} in a convenient class of functions, we define and solve its corresponding initial value problem, and we state conditions under which the solution is of class $C^k,\, k \geq 0$. More specifically, we prove that if some a priori information is specified, then the initial value problem is well-posed and it can be solved using only a {\em finite number} of local initial data. Also, motivated by some intriguing work by Dragovich and Aref'eva-Volovich on cosmology, we solve explicitly field equations of the form \begin{equation*} \zeta(\partial_t + h) \phi = J(t) \; , \; \; \; t \geq 0 \; , \end{equation*} in which $\zeta$ is the Riemann zeta function and $h > 1$. Finally, we remark that the $L^2$ case of our general theory allows us to give a precise meaning to the often-used interpretation of $f(\partial_t)$ as an operator defined by a power series in the differential operator $\partial_t$.

"  In this paper, we report recent improvements to the exemplar-based learning approach for word sense disambiguation that have achieved higher disambiguation accuracy. By using a larger value of $k$, the number of nearest neighbors to use for determining the class of a test example, and through 10-fold cross validation to automatically determine the best $k$, we have obtained improved disambiguation accuracy on a large sense-tagged corpus first used in \cite{ng96}. The accuracy achieved by our improved exemplar-based classifier is comparable to the accuracy on the same data set obtained by the Naive-Bayes algorithm, which was reported in \cite{mooney96} to have the highest disambiguation accuracy among seven state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms.

"  We study, by direct numerical simulations in two and three dimensions, the instability caused by the settling and evaporation of water droplets out of a cloudy layer saturated with vapour into a dry sub-cloud ambient, under conditions where mammatus clouds were shown to form by [1], but with the addition of background shear. We show that shear changes the type of cloud formation qualitatively, from mammatus-like to a newly identified cloud type called asperitas. Intermediate levels of shear are shown to be needed. Shear suppresses the growth of small-scale perturbations, giving rise to smooth, long-lasting structures, and smaller rates of mixing. Three-dimensionality is shown to make a qualitative difference, unlike in mammatus clouds. We also show that under non-cloud-like conditions, the instability can be very different.

"  In effective single-electron theories, self-interaction manifests itself through the unphysical dependence of the energy of an electronic state as a function of its occupation, which results in important deviations from the ideal Koopmans trend and strongly affects the accuracy of electronic-structure predictions. Here, we study the non-Koopmans behavior of local and semilocal density-functional theory (DFT) total energy methods as a means to quantify and to correct self-interaction errors. We introduce a non-Koopmans self-interaction correction that generalizes the Perdew-Zunger scheme, and demonstrate its considerably improved performance in correcting the deficiencies of DFT approximations for self-interaction problems of fundamental and practical relevance.

"  The upgraded MIPP physics results are needed for the support of NuMI projects, atmospheric cosmic ray and neutrino programs worldwide and will permit a systematic study of non-perturbative QCD interctions. The MIPP TPC is the largest contributor to the MIPP event size by far. Its readout system and electronics were designed in the 1990's and limit it to a readout rate of 60 Hz in simple events and ~20 Hz in complicated events. With the readout chips designed for the ALICE collaboration at the LHC, we propose a low cost scheme of upgrading the MIPP data acquisition speed to 3000 Hz. This will also enable us to measure the medium energy numi target to be used for the NOvA/MINERvA experiments. We outline the capabilities of the upgraded MIPP detector to obtain high statistics particle production data on a number of nuclei that will help towards the understanding and simulation of hadronic showers in matter.

"  We study the $c$-approximate near neighbor problem under the continuous Fr\'echet distance: Given a set of $n$ polygonal curves with $m$ vertices, a radius $\delta > 0$, and a parameter $k \leq m$, we want to preprocess the curves into a data structure that, given a query curve $q$ with $k$ vertices, either returns an input curve with Fr\'echet distance at most $c\cdot \delta$ to $q$, or returns that there exists no input curve with Fr\'echet distance at most $\delta$ to $q$. We focus on the case where the input and the queries are one-dimensional polygonal curves -- also called time series -- and we give a comprehensive analysis for this case. We obtain new upper bounds that provide different tradeoffs between approximation factor, preprocessing time, and query time.   Our data structures improve upon the state of the art in several ways. We show that for any $0 < \varepsilon \leq 1$ an approximation factor of $(1+\varepsilon)$ can be achieved within the same asymptotic time bounds as the previously best result for $(2+\varepsilon)$. Moreover, we show that an approximation factor of $(2+\varepsilon)$ can be obtained by using preprocessing time and space $O(nm)$, which is linear in the input size, and query time in $O(\frac{1}{\varepsilon})^{k+2}$, where the previously best result used preprocessing time in $n \cdot O(\frac{m}{\varepsilon k})^k$ and query time in $O(1)^k$. We complement our upper bounds with matching conditional lower bounds based on the Orthogonal Vectors Hypothesis. Interestingly, some of our lower bounds already hold for any super-constant value of $k$. This is achieved by proving hardness of a one-sided sparse version of the Orthogonal Vectors problem as an intermediate problem, which we believe to be of independent interest.

"  Consider the time-dependent problem of mass transfer of a solute between two phases and assume that the solute is initially distributed in one phase (phase 2) and absent from the other (phase 1). We desire the fraction of total solute present in phase 1 as a function of time, ${\cal S}(t)$, which we call the {\it spreadability}, since it is a measure of the spreadability of diffusion information as a function of time. We derive exact direct-space formulas for ${\cal S}(t)$ in any Euclidean space dimension $d$ in terms of the autocovariance function as well as corresponding Fourier representations of ${\cal S}(t)$ in terms of the spectral density. We derive closed-form general formulas for the short- and long-time behaviors of the spreadability in terms of crucial small- and large-scale microstructural information, respectively. The long-time behavior of ${\cal S}(t)$ enables one to distinguish the entire spectrum of microstructures that span from hyperuniform to nonhyperuniform media. For hyperuniform media, disordered or not, we show that the ""excess"" spreadability, ${\cal S}(\infty)-{\cal S}(t)$, decays to its long-time behavior exponentially faster than that of any nonhyperuniform two-phase medium, the ""slowest"" being antihyperuniform media. The stealthy hyperuniform class is characterized by an excess spreadability with the fastest decay rate among all translationally invariant microstructures. Moreover, we establish a remarkable connection between the spreadability and an outstanding problem in discrete geometry, namely, microstructures with ""fast"" spreadabilities are also those that can be derived from efficient ""coverings"" of space. We also identify heretofore unnoticed remarkable links between the spreadability ${\cal S}(t)$ and NMR pulsed field gradient spin-echo amplitude as well as diffusion MRI measurements.

"  By means of lattice-based Monte Carlo simulations, we address properties of two-component lipid membranes on the experimentally relevant spatial scales of order of a micrometer and time intervals of order of a second, using DMPC/DSPC lipid mixtures as a model system. Our large-scale simulations allowed us to obtain important results previously not reported in simulation studies of lipid membranes. We find that, within a certain range of lipid compositions, the phase transition from the fluid phase to the fluid-gel phase coexistence proceeds via near-critical fluctuations, while for other lipid compositions this phase transition has a quasi-abrupt character. In the presence of near-critical fluctuations, transient subdiffusion of lipid molecules is observed. These features of the system are stable with respect to perturbations in lipid interaction parameters used in our simulations. The line tension characterizing lipid domains in the fluid-gel coexistence region is found to be in the pN range. When approaching the critical point, the line tension, the inverse correlation length of fluid-gel spatial fluctuations, and the corresponding inverse order parameter susceptibility of the membrane vanish. All these results are in agreement with recent experimental findings for model lipid membranes. Our analysis of the domain coarsening dynamics after an abrupt quench of the membrane to the fluid-gel coexistence region reveals that lateral diffusion of lipids plays an important role in the fluid-gel phase separation process.

"  Academic search engines allow scientists to explore related work relevant to a given query. Often, the user is also aware of the ""aspect"" to retrieve a relevant document. In such cases, existing search engines can be used by expanding the query with terms describing that aspect. However, this approach does not guarantee good results since plain keyword matches do not always imply relevance. To address this issue, we define and solve a novel academic search task, called ""aspect-based retrieval"", which allows the user to specify the aspect along with the query to retrieve a ranked list of relevant documents. The primary idea is to estimate a language model for the aspect as well as the query using a domain-specific knowledge base and use a mixture of the two to determine the relevance of the article.

"  We report the evolution of the electronic nematic susceptibility in FeSe via Raman scattering as a function of hydrostatic pressure up to 5.8 GPa where the superconducting transition temperature $T_{c}$ reaches its maximum. The critical nematic fluctuations observed at low pressure vanish above 1.6 GPa, indicating they play a marginal role in the four-fold enhancement of $T_{c}$ at higher pressures. The collapse of nematic fluctuations appears to be linked to a suppression of low energy electronic excitations which manifests itself by optical phonon anomalies at around 2 GPa, in agreement with lattice dynamical and electronic structure calculations using local density approximation combined with dynamical mean field theory. Our results reveal two different regimes of nematicity in the phase diagram of FeSe under pressure: a d-wave Pomeranchuk instability of the Fermi surface at low pressure and a magnetic driven orthorhombic distortion at higher pressure.

"  We report on room temperature ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) studies of [$t$ Co$|2t$ Ni]$\times$N sputtered films, where $0.1 \leq t \leq 0.6$ nm. Two series of films were investigated: films with same number of Co$|$Ni bilayer repeats (N=12), and samples in which the overall magnetic layer thickness is kept constant at 3.6 nm (N=1.2/$t$). The FMR measurements were conducted with a high frequency broadband coplanar waveguide up to 50 GHz using a flip-chip method. The resonance field and the full width at half maximum were measured as a function of frequency for the field in-plane and field normal to the plane, and as a function of angle to the plane for several frequencies. For both sets of films, we find evidence for the presence of first and second order anisotropy constants, $K_1$ and $K_2$. The anisotropy constants are strongly dependent on the thickness $t$, and to a lesser extent on the total thickness of the magnetic multilayer. The Land\'e g-factor increases with decreasing $t$ and is practically independent of the multilayer thickness. The magnetic damping parameter $\alpha$, estimated from the linear dependence of the linewidth, $\triangle H$, on frequency, in the field in-plane geometry, increases with decreasing $t$. This behaviour is attributed to an enhancement of spin-orbit interactions with $t$ decreasing and in thinner films, to a spin-pumping contribution to the damping.

"  The usual interpretational rule of quantum mechanics which states that outcomes do not occur when their weights are zero is changed so as to preclude outcomes with weights less than a small but positive value. With this ""positive preclusion"" rule, and in the absence of any notion of objective probability, Everett quantum mechanics has the explanatory power to account for the evolution of organisms with subjective expectations of probability that are in accord with the Born rule. Positive preclusion also allows for the derivation of a connection between weight and relative frequency in situations involving a finite number of measurements.

"  Unstructured data from diverse sources, such as social media and aerial imagery, can provide valuable up-to-date information for intelligent situation assessment. Mining these different information sources could bring major benefits to applications such as situation awareness in disaster zones and mapping the spread of diseases. Such applications depend on classifying the situation across a region of interest, which can be depicted as a spatial ""heatmap"". Annotating unstructured data using crowdsourcing or automated classifiers produces individual classifications at sparse locations that typically contain many errors. We propose a novel Bayesian approach that models the relevance, error rates and bias of each information source, enabling us to learn a spatial Gaussian Process classifier by aggregating data from multiple sources with varying reliability and relevance. Our method does not require gold-labelled data and can make predictions at any location in an area of interest given only sparse observations. We show empirically that our approach can handle noisy and biased data sources, and that simultaneously inferring reliability and transferring information between neighbouring reports leads to more accurate predictions. We demonstrate our method on two real-world problems from disaster response, showing how our approach reduces the amount of crowdsourced data required and can be used to generate valuable heatmap visualisations from SMS messages and satellite images.

The objectives are to design a fly-by mission to Alpha Centauri with a total mission duration of 50 years travelling at a cruise speed of 0.1c. Furthermore, optical data from the target star system is to be obtained and sent back to the Solar system. The main challenges of such a mission are presented and possible solutions proposed. The results show that by extrapolating from currently existing technology, such a mission would be feasible.

"  The goal of this investigation was the assessment of acoustic infant vocalizations by laypersons. More specifically, the goal was to identify (1) the set of most salient classes for infant vocalizations, (2) their relationship to each other and to affective ratings, and (3) proposals for classification schemes based on these labels and relationships. The assessment behavior of laypersons has not yet been investigated, as current infant vocalization classification schemes have been aimed at professional and scientific applications. The study methodology was based on the Nijmegen protocol, in which participants rated vocalization recordings regarding acoustic class labels, and continuous affective scales valence, tense arousal and energetic arousal. We determined consensus stimuli ratings as well as stimuli similarities based on participant ratings. Our main findings are: (1) we identified 9 salient labels, (2) valence has the overall greatest association to label ratings, (3) there is a strong association between label and valence ratings in the negative valence space, but low association for neutral labels, and (4) stimuli separability is highest when grouping labels into 3 - 5 classes. We finally propose two classification schemes based on these findings. ",Investigation of the Assessment of Infant Vocalizations by Laypersons

"  As companies continue to invest heavily in larger, more accurate and more robust deep learning models, they are exploring approaches to monetize their models while protecting their intellectual property. Model licensing is promising, but requires a robust tool for owners to claim ownership of models, i.e. a watermark. Unfortunately, current designs have not been able to address piracy attacks, where third parties falsely claim model ownership by embedding their own ""pirate watermarks"" into an already-watermarked model. We observe that resistance to piracy attacks is fundamentally at odds with the current use of incremental training to embed watermarks into models. In this work, we propose null embedding, a new way to build piracy-resistant watermarks into DNNs that can only take place at a model's initial training. A null embedding takes a bit string (watermark value) as input, and builds strong dependencies between the model's normal classification accuracy and the watermark. As a result, attackers cannot remove an embedded watermark via tuning or incremental training, and cannot add new pirate watermarks to already watermarked models. We empirically show that our proposed watermarks achieve piracy resistance and other watermark properties, over a wide range of tasks and models. Finally, we explore a number of adaptive counter-measures, and show our watermark remains robust against a variety of model modifications, including model fine-tuning, compression, and existing methods to detect/remove backdoors. Our watermarked models are also amenable to transfer learning without losing their watermark properties. ",Piracy Resistant Watermarks for Deep Neural Networks

"  The absorption system at $z=3.572$ towards Q1937--1009 provides the best extragalactic measurement of the atomic deuterium to hydrogen ratio, D/H. We have obtained a new low-resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) Keck spectrum to re-measure the total neutral hydrogen column density N(H I) using the amount of Lyman continuum absorption. We develop a new method to directly determine the intrinsic unabsorbed quasar continuum from low-resolution spectra of the \Lya forest for the first time. We use three types of spectra to measure N(H I): (1) A wide slit spectrum for flux calibration, (2) a high-resolution spectrum to determine the unabsorbed continuum between \Lya forest lines, and (3) a high SNR spectrum to measure the residual flux below the Lyman limit. We measure Log [N(H I)] = 17.86 $\pm$ 0.02 \cm2, which is reliable because N(H I) is fully specified by the data. This result is consistent with the N(H I) measured by Tytler, Fan & Burles (1996) from the Lyman series absorption lines, but not with absorption models proposed by Wampler (1996) nor estimates of the total N(H I) by Songaila et al. (1997), both of which suggested lower N(H I) and higher D/H. The Wampler models predict abundant flux below the Lyman limit which is absent from both our old and new spectra, taken with different instruments. The new Keck data is consistent with the data presented by Songaila et al. (1997). The results differ due to the different methods of analysis, and our measurement of the QSO continuum does not agree with the continuum models assumed by Songaila et al. (1997).

"  We follow the mathematical framework proposed by Bouchut and present in this contribution a dual entropy approach for determining equilibrium states of a lattice Boltzmann scheme. This method is expressed in terms of the dual of the mathematical entropy relative to the underlying conservation law. It appears as a good mathematical framework for establishing a ""H-theorem"" for the system of equations with discrete velocities. The dual entropy approach is used with D1Q3 lattice Boltzmann schemes for the Burgers equation. It conducts to the explicitation of three different equilibrium distributions of particles and induces naturally a nonlinear stability condition. Satisfactory numerical results for strong nonlinear shocks and rarefactions are presented. We prove also that the dual entropy approach can be applied with a D1Q3 lattice Boltzmann scheme for systems of linear and nonlinear acoustics and we present a numerical result with strong nonlinear waves for nonlinear acoustics. We establish also a negative result: with the present framework, the dual entropy approach cannot be used for the shallow water equations.

"  Motivated by the recently improved results from the Fermilab Lattice and MILC Collaborations on the hadronic matrix elements entering $\Delta M_{s,d}$ in $B_{s,d}^0-\bar B_{s,d}^0$ mixing, we determine the Universal Unitarity Triangle (UUT) in models with Constrained Minimal Flavour Violation (CMFV). Of particular importance are the very precise determinations of the ratio $|V_{ub}|/|V_{cb}|=0.0864\pm0.0025$ and of the angle $\gamma=(63.0\pm 2.1)^\circ$. They follow in this framework from the experimental values of $\Delta M_{d}/\Delta M_s$ and of the CP-asymmetry $S_{\psi K_S}$. As in CMFV models the new contributions to meson mixings can be described by a single flavour-universal variable $S(v)$, we next determine the CKM matrix elements $|V_{ts}|$, $|V_{td}|$, $|V_{cb}|$ and $|V_{ub}|$ as functions of $S(v)$ using the experimental value of $\Delta M_s$ as input. The lower bound on $S(v)$ in these models, derived by us in 2006, implies then upper bounds on these four CKM elements and on the CP-violating parameter $\varepsilon_K$, which turns out to be significantly below its experimental value. This strategy avoids the use of tree-level determinations of $|V_{ub}|$ and $|V_{cb}|$ that are presently subject to considerable uncertainties. On the other hand if $\varepsilon_K$ is used instead of $\Delta M_s$ as input, $\Delta M_{s,d}$ are found significantly above the data. In this manner we point out that the new lattice data have significantly sharpened the tension between $\Delta M_{s,d}$ and $\varepsilon_K$ within the CMFV framework. This implies the presence of new physics contributions beyond this framework that are responsible for the breakdown of the flavour universality of the function $S(v)$. We also present the implications of these results for $K^+\to\pi^+\nu\bar\nu$, $K_L\to\pi^0\nu\bar\nu$ and $B_{s,d}\to\mu^+\mu^-$ within the Standard Model.

Our results srongly suggest formation of a chiral edge striped phase in quantum Hall systems. The amplitude of the charge density oscillations decays slowly, perhaps as a square root of the distance from the edge; thus the spectrum of edge excitations is likely to be affected.

"  The electron capture process was studied for Xe$^{54+}$ colliding with H$_2$ molecules at the internal gas target of the ESR storage ring at GSI, Darmstadt. Cross section values for electron capture into excited projectile states were deduced from the observed emission cross section of Lyman radiation, being emitted by the hydrogen-like ions subsequent to the capture of a target electron. The ion beam energy range was varied between 5.5 MeV/u and 30.9 MeV/u by applying the deceleration mode of the ESR. Thus, electron capture data was recorded at the intermediate and in particular the low collision energy regime, well below the beam energy necessary to produce bare xenon ions. The obtained data is found to be in reasonable qualitative agreement with theoretical approaches, while a commonly applied empirical formula significantly overestimates the experimental findings.

"  We study the theory of scattering for the Maxwell-Schr""odinger system in space dimension 3, in the Coulomb gauge. We prove the existence of modified wave operators for that system with no size restriction on the Schr""odinger and Maxwell asymptotic data and we determine the asymptotic behaviour in time of solutions in the range of the wave operators. The method consists in partially solving the Maxwell equations for the potentials, substituting the result into the Schr""odinger equation, which then becomes both nonlinear and nonlocal in time. The Schr""odinger function is then parametrized in terms of an amplitude and a phase satisfying a suitable auxiliary system, and the Cauchy problem for that system, with prescribed asymptotic behaviour determined by the asymptotic data, is solved by an energy method, thereby leading to solutions of the original system with prescribed asymptotic behaviour in time.

Neural networks show great potential to aid physicians in the medical image analysis. This study investigates the use of varying amounts of synthetic brain T1-weighted (T1), post-contrast T1-weighted (T1Gd), T2-weighted (T2), and T2 Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) MR images created by a generative adversarial network to overcome the lack of annotated medical image data in training separate 2D U-Nets to segment enhancing tumor, peritumoral edema, and necrosis (non-enhancing tumor core) regions on gliomas. These synthetic MR images were assessed quantitively (SSIM=0.79) and qualitatively by a physician who found that the synthetic images seem stronger for delineation of structural boundaries but struggle more when gradient is significant, (e.g. edema signal in T2 modalities). Multiple 2D U-Nets were trained with original BraTS data and differing subsets of a quarter, half, three-quarters, and all synthetic MR images. There was not an obvious correlation between the improvement of values of the metrics in separate validation dataset for each structure and amount of synthetic data added, there is a strong correlation between the amount of synthetic data added and the number of best overall validation metrics. In summary, this study showed ability to generate high quality synthetic Flair, T2, T1, and T1CE MR images using the GAN. Using the synthetic MR images showed encouraging results to improve the U-Net segmentation performance which has the potential to address the scarcity of readily available medical images.

"  In this paper, we propose a deep residual network-based method, namely the DiCOVA-Net, to identify COVID-19 infected patients based on the acoustic recording of their coughs. Since there are far more healthy people than infected patients, this classification problem faces the challenge of imbalanced data. To improve the model's ability to recognize minority class (the infected patients), we introduce data augmentation and cost-sensitive methods into our model. Besides, considering the particularity of this task, we deploy some fine-tuning techniques to adjust the pre-training ResNet50. Furthermore, to improve the model's generalizability, we use ensemble learning to integrate prediction results from multiple base classifiers generated using different random seeds. To evaluate the proposed DiCOVA-Net's performance, we conducted experiments with the DiCOVA challenge dataset.

"  We investigate the property of the hadron-quark mixed phase using the Brueckner-Hartree-Fock model for hadron (hyperon) phase and the MIT bag model for quark phase. To satisfy the Gibbs conditions, charge density as well as baryon number density becomes non-uniform in the mixed phase, accompanying phase separation. We clarify the roles of the surface tension and the charge screening effect. We show that the screened Coulomb interaction tends to make the geometrical structure of the mixed phase less stable, and the resultant EOS becomes similar to the one given by the Maxwell construction. The composition of the mixed phase, however, is very different from that of the Maxwell construction; in particular, hyperons are completely suppressed in the mixed phase, because hadron phase is positively charged. This is a novel mechanism of hyperon suppression in compact stars. ",Hyperon suppression in hadron-quark mixed phase

"  We propose a novel string theory propagating in a non-commutative deformation of the four dimensional space T* T^2 whose scattering states correspond to superconformal theories in 5 dimensions and the scattering amplitudes compute superconformal indices of the corresponding 5d theories.

"  The paradigm in which magnetic fields play a crucial role in launching/collimating outflows in many astrophysical objects continues to gain support. However, semi-analytical models including the effect of magnetic fields on the dynamics and morphology of jets are still missing due to the intrinsic difficulties in integrating the equations describing a collimated, relativistic flow in the presence of gravity. Only few solutions have been found so far, due to the highly nonlinear character of the equations together with the need to blindly search for singularities. These numerical problems prevented a full exploration of the parameter space. We present a new integration scheme to solve r-self-similar, stationary, axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamics equations describing collimated, relativistic outflows crossing smoothly all the singular points (Alfven point and modified slow/fast points). For the first time, we are able to integrate from the disk mid-plane to downstream of the modified fast point. We discuss an ensemble of jet solutions, emphasising trends and features that can be compared to observables. We present, for the first time with a semi-analytical MHD model, solutions showing counter-rotation of the jet for a substantial fraction of its extent. We find diverse jet configurations with bulk Lorentz factors up to 10 and potential sites for recollimation between $10^3-10^7$ gravitational radii. Such extended coverage of the intervals of quantities, such as magnetic-to-thermal energy ratios at the base or the heights/widths of the recollimation region, makes our solutions suitable for application to many different systems where jets are launched.

"  Despite their widespread success, the application of deep neural networks to functional data remains scarce today. The infinite dimensionality of functional data means standard learning algorithms can be applied only after appropriate dimension reduction, typically achieved via basis expansions. Currently, these bases are chosen a priori without the information for the task at hand and thus may not be effective for the designated task. We instead propose to adaptively learn these bases in an end-to-end fashion. We introduce neural networks that employ a new Basis Layer whose hidden units are each basis functions themselves implemented as a micro neural network. Our architecture learns to apply parsimonious dimension reduction to functional inputs that focuses only on information relevant to the target rather than irrelevant variation in the input function. Across numerous classification/regression tasks with functional data, our method empirically outperforms other types of neural networks, and we prove that our approach is statistically consistent with low generalization error.

"  When drawing causal inference from observational data, there is always concern about unmeasured confounding. One way to tackle this is to conduct a sensitivity analysis. One widely-used sensitivity analysis framework hypothesizes the existence of a scalar unmeasured confounder U and asks how the causal conclusion would change were U measured and included in the primary analysis. Works along this line often make various parametric assumptions on U, for the sake of mathematical and computational simplicity. In this article, we substantively further this line of research by developing a valid sensitivity analysis that leaves the distribution of U unrestricted. Our semiparametric estimator has three desirable features compared to many existing methods in the literature. First, our method allows for a larger and more flexible family of models, and mitigates observable implications (Franks et al., 2019). Second, our methods work seamlessly with any primary analysis that models the outcome regression parametrically. Third, our method is easy to use and interpret. We construct both pointwise confidence intervals and confidence bands that are uniformly valid over a given sensitivity parameter space, thus formally accounting for unknown sensitivity parameters. We apply our proposed method on an influential yet controversial study of the causal relationship between war experiences and political activeness using observational data from Uganda.

"  Constraint-based control approaches offer a flexible way to specify robotic manipulation tasks and execute them on robots with many degrees of freedom. However, the specification of task constraints and their associated priorities usually requires a human-expert and often leads to tailor-made solutions for specific situations. This paper presents our recent efforts to automatically derive task constraints for a constraint-based robot controller from data and adapt them with respect to previously unseen situations (contexts). We use a programming-by-demonstration approach to generate training data in multiple variations (context changes) of a given task. From this data we learn a probabilistic model that maps context variables to task constraints and their respective soft task priorities. We evaluate our approach with 3 different dual-arm manipulation tasks on an industrial robot and show that it performs better in terms of reproduction accuracy than constraint-based controllers with manually specified constraints.

"  In the case of clustered data, an artificial neural network with logcosh loss function learns the bigger cluster rather than the mean of the two. Even more so, the ANN when used for regression of a set-valued function, will learn a value close to one of the choices, in other words, it learns one branch of the set-valued function with high accuracy. This work suggests a method that uses artificial neural networks with logcosh loss to find the branches of set-valued mappings in parameter-outcome sample sets and classifies the samples according to those branches. The method not only classifies the data based on these branches but also provides an accurate prediction for the majority cluster. The method successfully classifies the data based on an invisible feature.

"  In this paper, we analyze the behavior of the global clustering coefficient in scale free graphs. We are especially interested in the case of degree distribution with an infinite variance, since such degree distribution is usually observed in real-world networks of diverse nature.   There are two common definitions of the clustering coefficient of a graph: global clustering and average local clustering. It is widely believed that in real networks both clustering coefficients tend to some positive constant as the networks grow. There are several models for which the average local clustering coefficient tends to a positive constant. On the other hand, there are no models of scale-free networks with an infinite variance of degree distribution and with a constant global clustering.   In this paper we prove that if the degree distribution obeys the power law with an infinite variance, then the global clustering coefficient tends to zero with high probability as the size of a graph grows.

"  In this paper, we consider a multihop wireless sensor network (WSN) with multiple relay nodes for each hop where the amplify-and-forward (AF) scheme is employed. We present a strategy to jointly design the linear receiver and the power allocation parameters via an alternating optimization approach that maximizes the sum rate of the WSN. We derive constrained maximum sum-rate (MSR) expressions along with an algorithm to compute the linear receiver and the power allocation parameters with the optimal complex amplification coefficients for each relay node. Computer simulations show good performance of our proposed methods in terms of sum rate compared to the method with equal power allocation.

  We study two person nonzero-sum stochastic differential games with risk-sensitive discounted and ergodic cost criteria. Under certain conditions we establish a Nash equilibrium in Markov strategies for the discounted cost criterion and a Nash equilibrium in stationary strategies for the ergodic cost criterion.

"  In view of the current efforts to extend the KASCADE experiment (KASCADE-Grande) for observations of Extensive Air Showers (EAS) of primary energies up to 1 EeV, the features of muon arrival time distributions and their correlations with other observable EAS quantities have been scrutinised on basis of high-energy EAS, simulated with the Monte Carlo code CORSIKA and using in general the QGSJET model as generator. Methodically various correlations of adequately defined arrival time parameters with other EAS parameters have been investigated by invoking non-parametric methods for the analysis of multivariate distributions, studying the classification and misclassification probabilities of various observable sets. It turns out that adding the arrival time information and the multiplicity of muons spanning the observed time distributions has distinct effects improving the mass discrimination. A further outcome of the studies is the feature that for the considered ranges of primary energies and of distances from the shower axis the discrimination power of global arrival time distributions referring to the arrival time of the shower core is only marginally enhanced as compared to local distributions referring to the arrival of the locally first muon.

"  The recently proposed novel materials class called Weyl-Kondo semimetal (WKSM) is a time reversal invariant but inversion symmetry broken Kondo semimetal in which Weyl nodes are pushed to the Fermi level by the Kondo interaction. Here we explore whether CeCu$_{1+x}$As$_2$ may be a new WKSM candidate. We report on its single-crystal growth, structure determination and physical properties investigation. Previously published studies on polycrystalline samples suggest that it is indeed a Kondo semimetal, which is confirmed by our investigations on single crystals. X-ray diffraction reveals that CeCu$_{1+x}$As$_2$ crystallizes in a tetragonal centrosymmetric structure, although the inversion symmetry could still be broken locally due to partially occupied Cu sites. Chemical analysis results in an average occupation $x$ = 0.11(1). The electrical resistivity increases logarithmically with decreasing temperature, and saturates below 10 K. A Kondo temperature $T_{\mathrm{K}}$ $\approx$ 4 K is extracted from entropy, estimated from the specific heat measurements. From Hall effect experiments, a charge carrier density of $8.8 \times 10^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$ is extracted, a value characteristic of a semimetal. The magnetization shows pronounced anisotropy, with no evidence of magnetic ordering down to 0.4 K. We thus classify CeCu$_{1.11}$As$_2$ as a tetragonal Kondo semimetal with anisotropic magnetic properties, with a possibly broken inversion symmetry, thus fulfilling the necessary conditions for a WKSM state.

"  High Dynamic Range (HDR) images are generated using multiple exposures of a scene. When a hand-held camera is used to capture a static scene, these images need to be aligned by globally shifting each image in both dimensions. For a fast and robust alignment, the shift amount is commonly calculated using Median Threshold Bitmaps (MTB) and creating an image pyramid. In this study, we optimize these computations using a parallel processing approach utilizing GPU. Experimental evaluation shows that the proposed implementation achieves a speed-up of up to 6.24 times over the baseline multi-threaded CPU implementation on the alignment of one image pair.

"  When modeling vehicular traffic flow on highway networks via macroscopic models, suitable coupling conditions at the network nodes are crucial. Frequently, the evolution of traffic flow on each network edge is described in a lane-averaged fashion using a single-class Lighthill-Whitham-Richards model. At off-ramps, split ratios (i.e., what percentage of traffic exits the highway) are prescribed that can be drawn from historic data. In this situation, classical FIFO coupling conditions yield unrealistic results, in that a clogged off-ramp yields zero flux through the node. As a remedy, non-FIFO conditions have been proposed. However, as we demonstrate here, those lead to spurious re-routing of vehicles. Then, a new coupling model, FIFOQ, is presented that preserves the desirable properties of non-FIFO models, while not leading to any spurious re-routing.

"  We present an unbiased spectroscopic study of the Galactic supernova remnant (SNR) Cygnus Loop using the Large Sky Area Multi-object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) DR5. LAMOST features both a large field of view and a large aperture, which allow us to simultaneously obtain 4000 spectra at $\sim$3700-9000 \AA with R$\approx$1800. The Cygnus Loop is a prototype of middle-aged SNRs, which has the advantages of being bright, large in angular size, and relatively unobscured by dust. Along the line of sight to the Cygnus Loop, 2747 LAMOST DR5 spectra are found in total, which are spatially distributed over the entire remnant. This spectral sample is free of the selection bias of most previous studies, which often focus on bright filaments or regions bright in [O III]. Visual inspection verifies that 368 spectra (13$\%$ of the total) show clear spectral features to confirm their association with the remnant. In addition, 176 spectra with line emission show ambiguity of their origin but have a possible association to the SNR. In particular, the 154 spectra dominated by the SNR emission are further analyzed by identifying emission lines and measuring their intensities. We examine distributions of physical properties such as electron density and temperature, which vary significantly inside the remnant, using theoretical models. By combining a large number of the LAMOST spectra, a global spectrum representing the Cygnus Loop is constructed, which presents characteristics of radiative shocks. Finally, we discuss the effect of the unbiased spectral sample on the global spectrum and its implication to understand a spatially unresolved SNR in a distant galaxy.

The films exhibit ferromagnetic transition near 160 K as in the bulk SrRuO3, although the films are under 1.7% compressive strain. The observed magnetization is even higher than that of the bulk SrRuO3. In addition, we newly found that the magnetization relaxation after field removal is strongly anisotropic: two relaxation processes are involved when magnetic domains are aligned along the ab-plane.

"  Multi-level dark matter with diagonal and off-diagonal interactions shows a rich phenomenology in its self-scattering. If the interactions are mediated by a particle that is less massive than the dark matter, Sommerfeld effect can lead to resonant enhancement of the scattering. For mediators lighter than the level separation, dark matter particles can upscatter to excited states and de-excite by emitting these mediators. We compute these cross-sections, both above and below the kinematic threshold, in a generic two-component dark matter model and identify the large inelastic cross-section as a result of maximal mixing between the two states. A new route for cooling of large dark matter halos and a new drag force between two colliding halos are identified and shown to arise purely from the inelastic scattering.

"  We show that the surface states in topological insulators can be understood based on a well-known Shockley model, a one-dimensional tight-binding model with two atoms per elementary cell, connected via alternating tunneling amplitudes. We generalize the one-dimensional model to the three-dimensional case corresponding to the sequence of layers connected via the amplitudes, which depend on the in-plane momentum p = (p_x,p_y). The Hamiltonian of the model is described a (2 x 2) Hamiltonian with the off-diagonal element t(k,p) depending also on the out-of-plane momentum k. We show that the complex function t(k,p) defines the properties of the surface states. The surface states exist for the in-plane momenta p, where the winding number of the function t(k,p) is non-zero as k is changed from 0 to 2pi. The sign of the winding number defines the sublattice on which the surface states are localized. The equation t(k,p)=0 defines a vortex line in the three-dimensional momentum space. The projection of the vortex line on the two-dimensional momentum p space encircles the domain where the surface states exist. We illustrate how our approach works for a well-known TI model on a diamond lattice. We find that different configurations of the vortex lines are responsible for the ""weak"" and ""strong"" topological insulator phases. The phase transition occurs when the vortex lines reconnect from spiral to circular form. We discuss the Shockley model description of Bi_2Se_3 and the applicability of the continuous approximation for the description of the topological edge states. We conclude that the tight-binding model gives a better description of the surface states. ",Shockley model description of surface states in topological insulators

"  The spin dynamics of an interwell excitons gas has been investigated in n-i-n GaAs/AlGaAs coupled quantum wells (CQWs). In these heterostructures the electron and the hole are spatially separated in neighboring quantum wells by a narrow AlAs barrier, when an electric field is applied. The time evolution kinetics of the interwell exciton photoluminescence has been measured under resonant excitation of the 1sHH intrawell exciton, using a pulsed tunable laser. The formation of a collective exciton phase in time and the temperature dependence of its spin relaxation rate have been studied. The spin relaxation rate of the interwell excitons is strongly reduced in the collective phase. This observation provides evidence for the coherence of the indirect excitons collective phase at temperatures below a critical $T_c$.

"  This paper deals with the impact of fault prediction techniques on checkpointing strategies. We suppose that the fault-prediction system provides prediction windows instead of exact predictions, which dramatically complicates the analysis of the checkpointing strategies. We propose a new approach based upon two periodic modes, a regular mode outside prediction windows, and a proactive mode inside prediction windows, whenever the size of these windows is large enough. We are able to compute the best period for any size of the prediction windows, thereby deriving the scheduling strategy that minimizes platform waste. In addition, the results of this analytical evaluation are nicely corroborated by a comprehensive set of simulations, which demonstrate the validity of the model and the accuracy of the approach.

"  We consider populations structured by a phenotypic trait and a space variable, in a non-homogeneous environment. In the case of sex- ual populations, we are able to derive models close to existing mod- els in theoretical biology, from a structured population model. We then analyze the dynamics of the population using a simplified model, where the population either propagates through the whole space or it survives but remains confined in a limited range. For asexual pop- ulations, we show that the dynamics are simpler. In this case, the population cannot remain confined in a limited range, i.e. the popu- lation, if it does not get extinct, propagates through the whole space.

"  Unsupervised learning of cross-lingual word embedding offers elegant matching of words across languages, but has fundamental limitations in translating sentences. In this paper, we propose simple yet effective methods to improve word-by-word translation of cross-lingual embeddings, using only monolingual corpora but without any back-translation. We integrate a language model for context-aware search, and use a novel denoising autoencoder to handle reordering. Our system surpasses state-of-the-art unsupervised neural translation systems without costly iterative training. We also analyze the effect of vocabulary size and denoising type on the translation performance, which provides better understanding of learning the cross-lingual word embedding and its usage in translation.

"  We present photoionisation modelling of the intrinsic absorber in the bright quasar HS 1603+3820. We construct spectral energy distribution using optical/UV/X-ray observations as an input to photoionisation calculations. Spectra from Keck telescope show extremely high ratio of CIV to HI, for the first absorber in system A, named A1.

"  Numerical simulation of plasma turbulence in the Large Plasma Device (LAPD) [Gekelman et al, Rev. Sci. Inst., 62, 2875, 1991] is presented. The model, implemented in the BOUndary Turbulence (BOUT) code [M. Umansky et al, Contrib. Plasma Phys. 180, 887 (2009)], includes 3-D collisional fluid equations for plasma density, electron parallel momentum, and current continuity, and also includes the effects of ion-neutral collisions. In nonlinear simulations using measured LAPD density profiles but assuming constant temperature profile for simplicity, self-consistent evolution of instabilities and nonlinearly-generated zonal flows results in a saturated turbulent state. Comparisons of these simulations with measurements in LAPD plasmas reveal good qualitative and reasonable quantitative agreement, in particular in frequency spectrum, spatial correlation and amplitude probability distribution function of density fluctuations. For comparison with LAPD measurements, the plasma density profile in simulations is maintained either by direct azimuthal averaging on each time step, or by adding particle source/sink function. The inferred source/sink values are consistent with the estimated ionization source and parallel losses in LAPD. These simulations lay the groundwork for more a comprehensive effort to test fluid turbulence simulation against LAPD data. ",Modeling of plasma turbulence and transport in the Large Plasma Device
"  Robotic systems for retail have gained a lot of attention due to the labor-intensive nature of such business environments. Many tasks have the potential to be automated via intelligent robotic systems that have manipulation capabilities. For example, empty shelves can be replenished, stray products can be picked up or new items can be delivered. However, many challenges make the realization of this vision a challenge. In particular, robots are still too expensive and do not work out of the box. In this paper, we discuss a work-in-progress approach for enabling power-on-and-go robots in retail environments through a combination of active, physical sensors and passive, artificial sensors. In particular, we use low-cost hardware sensors in conjunction with machine learning techniques in order to generate high-quality environmental information. More specifically, we present a setup in which a standard monocular camera and Bluetooth low-energy yield a reliable robot system that can immediately be used after placing a couple of sensors in the environment. The camera information is used to synthesize accurate 3D point clouds, whereas the BLE data is used to integrate the data into a complex map of the environment. The combination of active and passive sensing enables high-quality sensing capabilities at a fraction of the costs traditionally associated with such tasks.

"  The T2K long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment in Japan needs precise predictions of the initial neutrino flux. The highest precision can be reached based on detailed measurements of hadron emission from the same target as used by T2K exposed to a proton beam of the same kinetic energy of 30 GeV. The corresponding data were recorded in 2007-2010 by the NA61/SHINE experiment at the CERN SPS using a replica of the T2K graphite target. In this paper details of the experiment, data taking, data analysis method and results from the 2007 pilot run are presented.

"  Analytical formulas are presented for simplified but useful qubit geometries that predict surface dielectric loss when its thickness is much less than the metal thickness, the limiting case needed for real devices. These formulas can thus be used to precisely predict loss and optimize the qubit layout. Surprisingly, a significant fraction of surface loss comes from the small wire that connects the Josephson junction to the qubit capacitor. Tapering this wire is shown to significantly lower its loss. Also predicted are the size and density of the two-level state (TLS) spectrum from individual surface dissipation sites.

"  In this note we study the applicability of the color-kinematics duality to the scattering of two distinguishable scalar matter particles with gluon emission in QCD, or graviton emission in Einstein gravity. Previous analysis suggested that direct use of the Bern-Carrasco-Johansson double-copy prescription to matter amplitudes does not reproduce the gravitational amplitude in multi-Regge kinematics. This situation, however, can be avoided by extensions to the gauge theory, while maintaning the same Regge limit. Here we present two examples of these extensions: the introduction of a scalar contact interaction and the relaxation of the distinguishability of the scalars. In both cases new diagrams allow for a full reconstruction of the correct Regge limit on the gravitational side. Both modifications correspond to theories obtained by dimensional reduction from higher-dimensional gauge theories. ",Color-Kinematics Duality in Multi-Regge Kinematics and Dimensional   Reduction
"  Various field and laboratory experiments show that prey refuge plays a significant role in the stability of prey-predator dynamics. On the other hand, theoretical studies show that delayed system exhibits a much more realistic dynamics than its non-delayed counterpart. In this paper, we study a multi-delayed prey-predator model with prey refuge. We consider modified Holling Type II response function that incorporates the effect of prey refuge and then introduce two discrete delays in the model system. A negative feedback delay is considered in the logistic prey growth rate to represent density dependent feedback mechanism and a positive feedback delay is considered to represent the gestation time of the predator. Our study reveals that the system exhibits different dynamical behaviors, viz., stable coexistence, periodic coexistence or chaos depending on the values of the delay parameters and degree of prey refuge. The interplay between two delays for a fixed value of prey refuge has also been determined. It is noticed that these delays work in a complementary fashion. In addition, using the normal form theory and center manifold argument, we derive the explicit formulae for determining the direction of the bifurcation, the stability and other properties of the bifurcating periodic solutions.

"  We construct a continuous state branching process with immigration (CBI) whose immigration depends on the CBI itself and we recover a continuous state branching process (CB).

Using exponential formula, we compute the probability of extinction of the original type population in a critical or sub-critical quadratic branching, conditionally on the non extinction of the total population.

"  Let $S$ be a minimal mass blow up solution of the critical generalized KdV equation as constructed by Martel, Merle and Rapha\""el in arXiv:1204.4624. We prove both time and space sharp asymptotics for $S$ close to the blow up time. Let $Q$ be the unique ground state of (gKdV), satisfying $Q""+Q^5=Q$.   First, we show that there exist universal smooth profiles $Q_k\in\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R})$ (with $Q_0=Q$) and a constant $c_0\in\mathbb{R}$ such that, fixing the blow up time at $t=0$ and appropriate scaling and translation parameters, $S$ satisfies, for any $m\geqslant 0$, \[ \partial_x^m S(t) - \sum_{k=0}^{[m/2]} \frac 1{t^{\frac 12+m-2k}} Q_k^{(m-k)}\left(\frac{\cdot+ \frac1t}{t}+c_0\right)\to 0\quad \mbox{in}\ L^2 \mbox{as}\ t\downarrow 0. \] Second, we prove that, for $0<t\ll 1$, $x\leqslant -\frac 1t -1$, \[ S(t,x) \sim - \frac 12 \|Q\|_{L^1} |x|^{-3/2}, \] and related bounds for the derivatives of $S(t)$ of any order.

"  We demonstrate that any scaling source in the radiation era produces a background of gravitational waves with an exact scale-invariant power spectrum. Cosmic defects, created after a phase transition in the early Universe, are such a scaling source. We emphasise that the result is independent of the topology of the cosmic defects, the order of phase transition, and the nature of the symmetry broken, global or gauged. As an example, using large-scale numerical simulations, we calculate the scale invariant gravitational wave power spectrum generated by the dynamics of a global O(N) scalar theory. The result approaches the large N theoretical prediction as N^(-2), albeit with a large coefficient. The signal from global cosmic strings is O(100) times larger than the large N prediction.

"  $\kappa$ Andromedae, an early type star that hosts a directly imaged low mass companion, is expected to be oblate due to its rapid rotational velocity ($v\sin i$ = $\sim$162 $\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$). We observed the star with the CHARA Array's optical beam combiner, PAVO, measuring its size at multiple orientations and determining its oblateness. The interferometric measurements, combined with photometry and this $v\sin i$ value are used to constrain an oblate star model that yields the fundamental properties of the star and finds a rotation speed that is $\sim$85\% of the critical rate and a low inclination of $\sim$30$^\circ$. Three modeled properties (the average radius, bolometric luminosity, and equatorial velocity) are compared to MESA evolution models to determine an age and mass for the star. In doing so, we determine an age for the system of 47$^{+27}_{-40}$ Myr. Based on this age and previous measurements of the companion's temperature, the BHAC15 evolution models imply a mass for the companion of 22$^{+8}_{-9}$ M$_\mathrm{J}$.

"  We study the heat transfer between two finite quantum systems initially at different temperatures. We find that a recently proposed fluctuation theorem for heat exchange, namely the exchange fluctuation theorem [C. Jarzynski and D. K. Wojcik, Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 230602 (2004)], does not generally hold in the presence of a finite heat transfer as in the original form proved for weak coupling. As the coupling is weakened, the deviation from the theorem and the heat transfer vanish in the same order of the coupling. We then discover a condition for the exchange fluctuation theorem to hold in the presence of a finite heat transfer, namely the commutable-coupling condition.   We explicitly calculate the deviation from the exchange fluctuation theorem as well as the heat transfer for simple models. We confirm for the models that the deviation indeed has a finite value as far as the coupling between the two systems is finite except for the special point of the commutable-coupling condition. We also confirm analytically that the commutable-coupling condition indeed lets the exchange fluctuation theorem hold exactly under a finite heat transfer.

"  We consider the problem of blind identification and equalization of single-input multiple-output (SIMO) nonlinear channels. Specifically, the nonlinear model consists of multiple single-channel Wiener systems that are excited by a common input signal. The proposed approach is based on a well-known blind identification technique for linear SIMO systems. By transforming the output signals into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), a linear identification problem is obtained, which we propose to solve through an iterative procedure that alternates between canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to estimate the linear parts, and kernel canonical correlation (KCCA) to estimate the memoryless nonlinearities. The proposed algorithm is able to operate on systems with as few as two output channels, on relatively small data sets and on colored signals. Simulations are included to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique. ",Blind Identification of SIMO Wiener Systems based on Kernel Canonical   Correlation Analysis

We provide stacked, sky-subtracted images in $YJHK_{\rm s}$ and narrow-band filters constructed from data collected during the first year of UltraVISTA observations. Our stacked images reach $5\sigma$ $AB$ depths in an aperture of $2\arcsec$ diameter of $\sim 25$ in $Y$ and $\sim 24$ in $JHK_{\rm s}$ bands and all have sub-arcsecond seeing. To this $5\sigma$ limit, our $K_{\rm s}$ catalogue contains 216,268 sources. We carry out a series of quality assessment tests on our images and catalogues, comparing our stacks with existing catalogues. The $1\sigma$ astrometric RMS in both directions for stars selected with $17.0<K_{\rm s}\rm {(AB)} <19.5$ is $\sim 0.08\arcsec$ in comparison to the publicly-available COSMOS ACS catalogues. Our images are resampled to the same pixel scale and tangent point as the publicly available COSMOS data and so may be easily used to generate multi-colour catalogues using this data.

For a planer medium, efficient contour tracking algorithms have already been devised, but a new degree of freedom has quite a few challenges. Here we devise an algorithm based on klinokinesis - where the motion of the worm is in response to the stimuli but not proportional to it. Thus the path followed is not the shortest, but we can track the set concentration successfully.

"  We report a detection of the excited 220-211 rotational transition of para-H2O in APM 08279+5255 using the IRAM Plateau de Bure interferometer. At z = 3.91, this is the highest-redshift detection of interstellar water to date. From LVG modeling, we conclude that this transition is predominantly radiatively pumped and on its own does not provide a good estimate of the water abundance. However, additional water transitions are predicted to be detectable in this source, which would lead to an improved excitation model. We also present a sensitive upper limit for the HF J = 1 - 0 absorption toward APM 08279+5255. While the face-on geometry of this source is not favorable for absorption studies, the lack of HF absorption is still puzzling and may be indicative of a lower fluorine abundance at z = 3.91 compared with the Galactic ISM.

"  The mean area of a two-dimensional Gaussian ring of $N$ monomers is known to diverge when the ring is subject to a critical pressure differential, $p_c \sim N^{-1}$. In a recent publication [Eur. Phys. J. E 19, 461 (2006)] we have shown that for an inextensible freely jointed ring this divergence turns into a second-order transition from a crumpled state, where the mean area scales as $<A> \sim N$, to a smooth state with $<A> \sim N^2$. In the current work we extend these two models to the case where the swelling of the ring is caused by trapped ideal-gas particles. The Gaussian model is solved exactly, and the freely jointed one is treated using a Flory argument, mean-field theory, and Monte Carlo simulations. For fixed number $Q$ of trapped particles the criticality disappears in both models through an unusual mechanism, arising from the absence of an area constraint. In the Gaussian case the ring swells to such a mean area, $<A> \sim NQ$, that the pressure exerted by the particles is at $p_c$ for any $Q$. In the freely jointed model the mean area is such that the particle pressure is always higher than $p_c$, and $<A>$ consequently follows a single scaling law, $<A> \sim N^2 f(Q/N)$, for any $Q$. By contrast, when the particles are in contact with a reservoir of fixed chemical potential, the criticality is retained. Thus, the two ensembles are manifestly inequivalent in these systems.

"  We solve for all Szekeres metrics that have a single Killing vector. For quasi hyperboloidal ($\epsilon = -1$) metrics, we find that translational symmetries are possible, but only in metrics that have shell crossings somewhere, while metrics that can be made free of shell crossings only permit rotations. The quasi planar metrics ($\epsilon = 0$) either have no Killing vectors or they admit full planar symmetry. Single symmetries in quasi spherical metrics ($\epsilon = +1$) are all rotations. The rotations correspond to a known family of axially symmetric metrics, which for each $\epsilon$ value, are equivalent to each other. We consider Szekeres metrics in which the line of dipole extrema is required to be geodesic in the 3-space, and show the same set of families emerges. We investigate when two Szekeres metrics are physically equivalent, and complete a previous list of transformations of the arbitrary functions. ",Symmetry and Equivalence in Szekeres Models

We extract the raw reconstructed charge asymmetry by fitting the invariant mass distributions for the sum and difference of charge-specific samples. This quantity is then corrected for detector-related asymmetries using data-driven methods and for possible physics asymmetries (from B -> D processes) using input from Monte Carlo simulation. We measure A_CP = [-0.16 +- 0.15 (stat.) +- 0.09 (syst.)]%, which is consistent with zero, as expected from the standard model prediction of CP conservation, and is the most precise measurement of this quantity to date ",Measurement of the direct CP-violating parameter A_CP in the decay D+ ->   K- pi+ pi+
"  Cherkis bow varieties are believed to be the set of spaces where 3d mirror symmetry for characteristic classes can be observed. We describe geometric structures on a large class of Cherkis bow varieties by developing the necessary combinatorial presentations, including binary contingency tables and skein diagrams.

Additionally we provide an account of the full statement, with examples, for elliptic stable envelopes. ","Bow varieties---geometry, combinatorics, characteristic classes"
"  The paper considers bounded linear radial operators on the polyanalytic Fock spaces $\mathcal{F}_n$ and on the true-polyanalytic Fock spaces $\mathcal{F}_{(n)}$. The orthonormal basis of normalized complex Hermite polynomials plays a crucial role in this study; it can be obtained by the orthogonalization of monomials in $z$ and $\overline{z}$. First, using this basis, we decompose the von Neumann algebra of radial operators, acting in $\mathcal{F}_n$, into the direct sum of some matrix algebras, i.e. radial operators are represented as matrix sequences. Secondly, we prove that the radial operators, acting in $\mathcal{F}_{(n)}$, are diagonal with respect to the basis of the complex Hermite polynomials belonging to $\mathcal{F}_{(n)}$. We also provide direct proofs of the fundamental properties of $\mathcal{F}_n$ and an explicit description of the C*-algebra generated by Toeplitz operators in $\mathcal{F}_{(n)}$, whose generating symbols are radial, bounded, and have finite limits at infinity.

"  We study asymptotically flat stationary solutions of four-dimensional supergravity theories via the associated G/H* pseudo-Riemannian non-linear sigma models in three spatial dimensions. The Noether charge C associated to G is shown to satisfy a characteristic equation that determines it as a function of the four-dimensional conserved charges. The matrix C is nilpotent for non-rotating extremal solutions. The nilpotency degree of C is directly related to the BPS degree of the corresponding solution when they are BPS. Equivalently, the charges can be described in terms of a Weyl spinor |C > of Spin*(2N), and then the characteristic equation becomes equivalent to a generalisation of the Cartan pure spinor constraint on |C>. The invariance of a given solution with respect to supersymmetry is determined by an algebraic `Dirac equation' on the Weyl spinor |C>. We explicitly solve this equation for all pure supergravity theories and we characterise the stratified structure of the moduli space of asymptotically Taub-NUT black holes with respect with their BPS degree. The analysis is valid for any asymptotically flat stationary solutions for which the singularities are protected by horizons. The H*-orbits of extremal solutions are identified as Lagrangian submanifolds of nilpotent orbits of G, and so the moduli space of extremal spherically symmetric black holes as a Lagrangian subvariety of the variety of nilpotent elements of Lie(G). We also generalise the notion of active duality transformations to an `almost action' of the three-dimensional duality group G on asymptotically flat stationary solutions.

"  A Chern--Simons system in $2+1$ dimensions invariant under local Lorentz rotations, $SU(2)$ gauge transformations, and local $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry transformations is proposed. The field content is that of $(2+1)$-gravity plus an $SU(2)$ gauge field, a spin-1/2 fermion charged with respect to $SU(2)$ and a trivial free abelian gauge field. A peculiarity of the model is the absence of gravitini, although it includes gravity and supersymmetry. Likewise, no gauginos are present. All the parameters involved in the system are either protected by gauge invariance or emerge as integration constants. An effective mass and effective cosmological constant emerge by spontaneus breaking of local scaling invariance. The vacuum sector is defined by configurations with locally flat Lorentz and $SU(2)$ connections sporting nontrivial global charges. Three-dimensional Lorentz-flat geometries are spacetimes of locally constant negative --or zero--, Riemann curvature, which include Minkowski space, AdS$_3$, BTZ black holes, and point particles. These solutions admit different numbers of globally defined, covariantly constant spinors and are therefore good candidates for stable ground states. The fermionic sector in this system could describe the dynamics of electrons in graphene in the long wavelength limit near the Dirac points, with the spin degree of freedom of the electrons represented by the $SU(2)$ label. If this is the case, the $SU(2)$ gauge field would produce a spin-spin interaction giving rise to strong correlation of electron pairs.

"  We aim to constrain the temperature and velocity structures, and H2O abundances in the winds of a sample of M-type AGB stars. We further aim to determine the effect of H2O line cooling on the energy balance in the inner circumstellar envelope. We use two radiative-transfer codes to model molecular emission lines of CO and H2O towards four M-type AGB stars. We focus on spectrally resolved observations of CO and H2O from HIFI. The observations are complemented by ground-based CO observations, and spectrally unresolved CO and H2O observations with PAC. The observed line profiles constrain the velocity structure throughout the circumstellar envelopes (CSEs), while the CO intensities constrain the temperature structure in the CSEs. The H2O observations constrain the o-H2O and p-H2O abundances relative to H2. Finally, the radiative-transfer modelling allows to solve the energy balance in the CSE, in principle including also H2O line cooling. The fits to the line profiles only set moderate constraints on the velocity profile, indicating shallower acceleration profiles in the winds of M-type AGB stars than predicted by dynamical models, while the CO observations effectively constrain the temperature structure. Including H2O line cooling in the energy balance was only possible for the low-mass-loss-rate objects in the sample, and required an ad hoc adjustment of the dust velocity profile in order to counteract extreme cooling in the inner CSE. H2O line cooling was therefore excluded from the models. The constraints set on the temperature profile by the CO lines nevertheless allowed us to derive H2O abundances. The derived H2O abundances confirm previous estimates and are consistent with chemical models. However, the uncertainties in the derived abundances are relatively large, in particular for p-H2O, and consequently the derived o/p-H2O ratios are not well constrained.

"  The recent discovery of cosmic repulsion represents a major challenge to standard gravity, adding an apparent missing energy problem to its still not yet adequately resolved missing mass one, while simultaneously requiring the current universe to be a very special, fine-tuned one. We suggest that the resolution of these difficulties lies not in the existence of more and more exotic gravitational sources, but rather in the lack of reliability of the extrapolation of standard gravity from its solar system origins to the altogether larger distance scales associated with cosmology. We suggest a very different such extrapolation, namely that associated with conformal gravity, to find that all of these issues are then readily and naturally resolved.

"  Quark-gluon plasma during its initial phase after its production in heavy-ion collisions is expected to have substantial pressure anisotropies. In order to model this situation by a strongly coupled N=4 super-Yang-Mills plasma with fixed anisotropy by means of AdS/CFT duality, two models have been discussed in the literature. Janik and Witaszczyk have considered a geometry involving a comparatively benign naked singularity, while more recently Mateos and Trancanelli have used a regular geometry involving a nontrivial axion field dual to a parity-odd deformation of the gauge theory by a spatially varying theta parameter. We study the (rather different) implications of these two models on the heavy-quark potential as well as jet quenching and compare their respective predictions with those of weakly coupled anisotropic plasmas.

"  Phase transitions in anyon models in (2+1)-dimensions can be driven by condensation of bosonic particle sectors. We study such condensates in a diagrammatic language and explicitly establish the relation between the states in the fusion spaces of the theory with the condensate, to the states in the parent theory using a new set of mathematical quantities called vertex lifting coefficients (VLCs). These allow one to calculate the full set of topological data ($S$-, $T$-, $R$- and $F$-matrices) in the condensed phase. We provide closed form expressions of the topological data in terms of the VLCs and provide a method by which one can calculate the VLCs for a wide class of bosonic condensates. We furthermore furnish a concrete recipe to lift arbitrary diagrams directly from the condensed phase to the original phase, such that they can be evaluated using the data of the original theory and a limited number of VLCs. Some representative examples are worked out in detail. ",Diagrammatics for Bose condensation in anyon theories

This trigger favors events with higher average multiplicity than those in minimum bias. These events are likely to contain jets. The average multiplicity of a high-tower triggered event is similar to that of a minimum bias event containing a Xi, which implies that Xi baryons are likely to be produced in jets. Xi mean pT is higher in the triggered data then in the minimum bias sample. ",High Transverse Momentum Xi Baryon Correlations in p+p Collisions at   s^(1/2)=200 GeV
"  We revisit the study of the emptiness formation probability, the probability of forming a sequence of $\ell$ spins with the same ferromagnetic orientation in the ground-state of a quantum spin chain. We focus on two different examples, exhibiting strikingly different behavior: the XXZ and Ising chains. One has a conserved number of particles, the other does not. In the latter we show that the sequence of fixed spins can be viewed as an additional boundary in imaginary time. We then use conformal field theory (CFT) techniques to derive all universal terms in its scaling, and provide checks in free fermionic systems. These are based on numerical simulations or, when possible, mathematical results on the asymptotic behavior of Toeplitz and Toeplitz+Hankel determinants. A perturbed CFT analysis uncovers an interesting $\ell^{-1}\log \ell$ correction, that also appears in the closely related spin full counting statistics. The XXZ case turns out to be more challenging, as scale invariance is broken. We use a simple qualitative picture in which the ferromagnetic sequence of spins freezes all degrees of freedom inside of a certain ""arctic"" region, that we determine numerically. We also provide numerical evidence for the existence of universal logarithmic terms, generated by the massless field theory living outside of the arctic region.

"  Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Extraction (RE) are the core sub-tasks for information extraction. Many recent works formulate these two tasks as the span (pair) classification problem, and thus focus on investigating how to obtain a better span representation from the pre-trained encoder. However, a major limitation of existing works is that they ignore the dependencies between spans (pairs). In this work, we propose a novel span representation approach, named Packed Levitated Markers, to consider the dependencies between the spans (pairs) by strategically packing the markers in the encoder. In particular, we propose a group packing strategy to enable our model to process massive spans together to consider their dependencies with limited resources. Furthermore, for those more complicated span pair classification tasks, we design a subject-oriented packing strategy, which packs each subject and all its objects into an instance to model the dependencies between the same-subject span pairs. Our experiments show that our model with packed levitated markers outperforms the sequence labeling model by 0.4%-1.9% F1 on three flat NER tasks, beats the token concat model on six NER benchmarks, and obtains a 3.5%-3.6% strict relation F1 improvement with higher speed over previous SOTA models on ACE04 and ACE05.

"  The effectiveness of machine learning algorithms arises from being able to extract useful features from large amounts of data. As model and dataset sizes increase, dataset distillation methods that compress large datasets into significantly smaller yet highly performant ones will become valuable in terms of training efficiency and useful feature extraction. To that end, we apply a novel distributed kernel based meta-learning framework to achieve state-of-the-art results for dataset distillation using infinitely wide convolutional neural networks. For instance, using only 10 datapoints (0.02% of original dataset), we obtain over 64% test accuracy on CIFAR-10 image classification task, a dramatic improvement over the previous best test accuracy of 40%. Our state-of-the-art results extend across many other settings for MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN. Furthermore, we perform some preliminary analyses of our distilled datasets to shed light on how they differ from naturally occurring data.

"  This paper analyzes the impact and benefits of infrastructure support in improving the throughput scaling in networks of $n$ randomly located wireless nodes. The infrastructure uses multi-antenna base stations (BSs), in which the number of BSs and the number of antennas at each BS can scale at arbitrary rates relative to $n$. Under the model, capacity scaling laws are analyzed for both dense and extended networks. Two BS-based routing schemes are first introduced in this study: an infrastructure-supported single-hop (ISH) routing protocol with multiple-access uplink and broadcast downlink and an infrastructure-supported multi-hop (IMH) routing protocol. Then, their achievable throughput scalings are analyzed. These schemes are compared against two conventional schemes without BSs: the multi-hop (MH) transmission and hierarchical cooperation (HC) schemes. It is shown that a linear throughput scaling is achieved in dense networks, as in the case without help of BSs. In contrast, the proposed BS-based routing schemes can, under realistic network conditions, improve the throughput scaling significantly in extended networks. The gain comes from the following advantages of these BS-based protocols. First, more nodes can transmit simultaneously in the proposed scheme than in the MH scheme if the number of BSs and the number of antennas are large enough. Second, by improving the long-distance signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the received signal power can be larger than that of the HC, enabling a better throughput scaling under extended networks. Furthermore, by deriving the corresponding information-theoretic cut-set upper bounds, it is shown under extended networks that a combination of four schemes IMH, ISH, MH, and HC is order-optimal in all operating regimes.

"  Structured problems arise in many applications. To solve these problems, it is important to leverage the structure information. This paper focuses on convex problems with a finite-sum compositional structure. Finite-sum problems appear as the sample average approximation of a stochastic optimization problem and also arise in machine learning with a huge amount of training data. One popularly used numerical approach for finite-sum problems is the stochastic gradient method (SGM). However, the additional compositional structure prohibits easy access to unbiased stochastic approximation of the gradient, so directly applying the SGM to a finite-sum compositional optimization problem (COP) is often inefficient.   We design new algorithms for solving strongly-convex and also convex two-level finite-sum COPs. Our design incorporates the Katyusha acceleration technique and adopts the mini-batch sampling from both outer-level and inner-level finite-sum. We first analyze the algorithm for strongly-convex finite-sum COPs. Similar to a few existing works, we obtain linear convergence rate in terms of the expected objective error, and from the convergence rate result, we then establish complexity results of the algorithm to produce an $\varepsilon$-solution. Our complexity results have the same dependence on the number of component functions as existing works. However, due to the use of Katyusha acceleration, our results have better dependence on the condition number $\kappa$ and improve to $\kappa^{2.5}$ from the best-known $\kappa^3$. Finally, we analyze the algorithm for convex finite-sum COPs, which uses as a subroutine the algorithm for strongly-convex finite-sum COPs. Again, we obtain better complexity results than existing works in terms of the dependence on $\varepsilon$, improving to $\varepsilon^{-2.5}$ from the best-known $\varepsilon^{-3}$.

To be emphasized, the second quantization Hamiltonian has the regular structures which correspond clearly to different physical processes. ",Idealization Second Quantization of Composite Particles
"  Heinz Hopf's famous fibrations of the 2n+1-sphere by great circles, the 4n+3-sphere by great 3-spheres, and the 15-sphere by great 7-spheres have a number of interesting properties. Besides providing the first examples of homotopically nontrivial maps from one sphere to another sphere of lower dimension, they all share two striking features:   (1) Their fibers are parallel, in the sense that any two fibers are a constant distance apart, and   (2) The fibrations are highly symmetric. For example, there is a fiber-preserving isometry of each total space which takes any given fiber to any other one.   Hopf fibrations have been characterized up to isometry by the first property above, initially among all fibrations of spheres by great subspheres, and later in the stronger sense among all fibrations of spheres by smooth subspheres.   In this paper, we show that the Hopf fibrations are also characterized by their ""fiberwise homogeneity"" expressed above in (2), and in the strong sense among all fibrations of spheres by smooth subspheres.   In the special case of the 3-sphere fibered by great circles, we prove something stronger. We prove that a fibration of a connected open set by great circles which is locally fiberwise homogeneous is part of a Hopf fibration.

"  The mutual and tripartite information between pairs and triples of disjoint regions in a quantum field theory are sensitive probes of the spread of correlations in an equilibrating system. We compute these quantities in strongly coupled two-dimensional conformal field theories with a gravity dual following the homogenous deposition of energy. The injected energy is modeled in anti-de Sitter space as an infalling shell, and the information shared by disjoint intervals is computed in terms of geodesic lengths in this background. For given widths and separation of the intervals, the mutual information typically starts at its vacuum value, then increases in time to reach a maximum, and then declines to the value at thermal equilibrium. A simple causality argument qualitatively explains this behavior. The tripartite information is generically non-zero and time-dependent throughout the process. This contrasts with (but does not contradict) the time-independent tripartite information one finds after a two-dimensional quantum quench in the limit of large time and distance scales compared to the initial inverse mass gap.

"  Large-scale solar eruptions are believed to have a magnetic flux rope as the core structure. However, it remains elusive as to how the flux rope builds up and what triggers its eruption. Recent observations found that a prominence erupted following multiple episodes of ""flux feeding"". During each episode, a chromospheric fibril rose and merged with the prominence lying above. In this letter, we carried out 2.5-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) numerical simulations to investigate whether the flux-feeding mechanism can explain such an eruption. The simulations demonstrate that the discrete emergence of small flux ropes can initiate eruptions by feeding axial flux into the preexistent flux rope until its total axial flux reaches a critical value. The onset of the eruption is dominated by an ideal MHD process. Our simulation results corroborate that the flux feeding is a viable mechanism to cause the eruption of solar magnetic flux ropes.

"  Background: Children are frequently prescribed medication off-label, meaning there has not been sufficient testing of the medication to determine its safety or effectiveness. The main reason this safety knowledge is lacking is due to ethical restrictions that prevent children from being included in the majority of clinical trials. Objective: The objective of this paper is to investigate whether an ensemble of simple study designs can be implemented to signal acutely occurring side effects effectively within the paediatric population by using historical longitudinal data. The majority of pharmacovigilance techniques are unsupervised, but this research presents a supervised framework. Methods: Multiple measures of association are calculated for each drug and medical event pair and these are used as features that are fed into a classiffier to determine the likelihood of the drug and medical event pair corresponding to an adverse drug reaction. The classiffier is trained using known adverse drug reactions or known non-adverse drug reaction relationships. Results: The novel ensemble framework obtained a false positive rate of 0:149, a sensitivity of 0:547 and a specificity of 0:851 when implemented on a reference set of drug and medical event pairs. The novel framework consistently outperformed each individual simple study design.

"  We use hydrodynamic simulations of minor mergers of galaxies to investigate the nature of surface brightness excesses at large radii observed in some spiral galaxies: antitruncated stellar disks. We find that this process can produce the antitruncation via two competing effects: (1) merger-driven gas inflows that concentrate mass in the center of the primary galaxy and contract its inner density profile; and (2) angular momentum transferred outwards by the interaction, causing the outer disk to expand. In our experiments, this requires both a significant supply of gas in the primary disk, and that the encounter be prograde with moderate orbital angular momentum. The stellar surface mass density profiles of our remnants both qualitatively and quantitatively resemble the broken exponentials observed in local face--on spirals that display antitruncations. Moreover, the observed trend towards more frequent antitruncation relative to classical truncation in earlier Hubble types is consistent with a merger-driven scenario.

In each case we test two closure schemes: 1) where third moments are defined by the diffusion approximation; and 2) where the full third moment equations are used and fourth moments are defined by a modified form of the quasi-normal approximation. In overshooting models, the convective flux becomes negative shortly after the stability boundary. The negative amplitude remains small, and the temperature gradient in the overshooting zone has nearly the radiative value. Turbulent velocities decay by a factor of $e$ after $0.5$--$1.5\ell$, depending on the model, where $\ell$ is the mixing length.

Although LRCs have small locality, they have lower minimum distance compare to the Singleton bound. Hence, seeking the largest possible minimum distance for LRCs have been the topic of many recent studies. In this paper, we study the largest possible minimum distance of a class of LRCs and evaluate them in terms of achievability. Furthermore, we compare our results with the existence bounds in the literature. ",On minimum distance of locally repairable codes

"  We find that the requirement of model interpretations to be faithful is vague and incomplete. With interpretation by textual highlights as a case-study, we present several failure cases. Borrowing concepts from social science, we identify that the problem is a misalignment between the causal chain of decisions (causal attribution) and the attribution of human behavior to the interpretation (social attribution). We re-formulate faithfulness as an accurate attribution of causality to the model, and introduce the concept of aligned faithfulness: faithful causal chains that are aligned with their expected social behavior. The two steps of causal attribution and social attribution together complete the process of explaining behavior. With this formalization, we characterize various failures of misaligned faithful highlight interpretations, and propose an alternative causal chain to remedy the issues. Finally, we implement highlight explanations of the proposed causal format using contrastive explanations. ",Aligning Faithful Interpretations with their Social Attribution

Previous molecular studies missed the identification of the outflow probably due to their smaller mapping area and the confusing spectral features present towards the object. Our detailed molecular line study of the full 1.6 pc extent of the optical flow shows evidence for both blueshifted and redshifted gas set in motion by Haro~6-10 activity. The molecular outflow is centered at Haro~6-10, with redshifted gas being clumpy and directed towards the northeast, while blueshifted gas is in the southwest direction. The molecular gas terminates well within the cloud, short of the most distant HH objects of the optical flow. Contamination from an unrelated cloud along the same line of sight prevents a thorough study of the blueshifted outflow lobe and the mass distribution at the lowest velocities in both lobes.

We reveal that the closed-form expression for the modal Purcell factor within the coupled mode theory slightly alters for the non-Hermitian coupled waveguide compared to the Hermitian case. It is true even near the exceptional point, where the eigenmodes coalesce and the Petermann factor goes to infinity.

As an application we show that for any self-dual cusp form Pi for SL(4,Z), there exists a Maass form pi for SL(2,Z) such that L(1/2, Pi x pi) is nonvanishing. An important ingredient is a ""balanced"" Voronoi summation formula involving Kloosterman sums on both sides, which can also be thought of as the functional equation of a certain double Dirichlet series involving Kloosterman sums and GL(4) Hecke eigenvalues.

"  Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged with a motive to automate the human life. It can be visualized as a network of connected things which is capable of providing intelligent services. This paper presents an IoT based security surveillance system in buildings using Raspberry Pi Single Board Computer (SBC) and NodeMCU (WiFi/IoT module). This system comprises of wireless sensor nodes and a controller section for surveillance. Intrusion detection with face detection and recognition, fire detection, remote user alerts, live video streaming and portability are the prime features of the system. The use of face recognition feature in intrusion detection makes the system more efficient by identifying the known and unknown person in restricted areas. WiFi module processes the sensor based events and sends the sensor status to controller section. Upon receiving the event notification, the controller enables the camera for capturing the event, alerts the user via email, phone call and Short Message Service (SMS) and places the live video of event on webpage. The use of WiFi module makes the node compact, cost effective and easy to use. The biggest advantage of the system is that the user can seek surveillance from anywhere in the world and can respond according to the situations.

"  Spatial Description Resolution, as a language-guided localization task, is proposed for target location in a panoramic street view, given corresponding language descriptions. Explicitly characterizing an object-level relationship while distilling spatial relationships are currently absent but crucial to this task. Mimicking humans, who sequentially traverse spatial relationship words and objects with a first-person view to locate their target, we propose a novel spatial relationship induced (SIRI) network. Specifically, visual features are firstly correlated at an implicit object-level in a projected latent space; then they are distilled by each spatial relationship word, resulting in each differently activated feature representing each spatial relationship. Further, we introduce global position priors to fix the absence of positional information, which may result in global positional reasoning ambiguities. Both the linguistic and visual features are concatenated to finalize the target localization. Experimental results on the Touchdown show that our method is around 24\% better than the state-of-the-art method in terms of accuracy, measured by an 80-pixel radius. Our method also generalizes well on our proposed extended dataset collected using the same settings as Touchdown. ",SIRI: Spatial Relation Induced Network For Spatial Description   Resolution
"  We present results from timing and spectral analysis of the HMXB X-ray pulsar IGR J19294+1816 observed using \asr during its recent Type-I outburst in October, 2019. AstroSat observations sampled the outburst at the decline phase right after the outburst peak. We carried out timing analysis on the light curves obtained using the Large Area X-ray Proportional Counter (LAXPC) instrument on board AstroSat and measured a spin period of 12.485065$\pm$0.000015 s. The peak in the power density spectrum (PDS) corresponding to the spin period of 12.48 s also shows a broadened base. We also detected a Quasi Periodic Oscillation (QPO) feature at 0.032$\pm$0.002 Hz with an RMS fractional amplitude of $\sim$18% in the PDS. We further carried out a joint spectral analysis using both the Soft X-ray Telescope (SXT) and the LAXPC instruments and detected a Cyclotron Resonant Scattering Feature (CRSF) at 42.7$\pm$0.9 keV and an Fe emission line at 6.4$\pm$0.1 keV. IGR J19294+1816, being an intermediate spin pulsar, has exhibited a plethora of spectral and timing features during its most recent 2019 outburst, adding it to the list of transients that exhibit both a QPO as well as a CRSF.

"  It has long been accepted that a possible mechanism for explaining the existence of magnetic white dwarfs is the merger of a binary white dwarf system, as there are viable mechanisms for producing sustainable magnetism within the merger product. However, the lack of rapid rotators in the magnetic white dwarf population has been always considered a problematic issue of this scenario. In order to explain this discrepancy we build a model in which the interaction between the magnetosphere of the star and the disk induces angular momentum transfer. Our model predicts that the magnetospheric interaction of magnetic white dwarfs with their disks results in a significant spin down, and we show that the observed rotation period of REJ 0317-853, which is suggested to be a product of a double degenerate merger, can be reproduced.

"  The recent experimental advances in capacitively coupled singlet-triplet qubits, particularly the demonstration of entanglement, opens the question of what type of entangling gates the system's Hamiltonian can produce directly via a single square pulse. We address this question by considering the system's Hamiltonian from first principles and using the representation of its nonlocal properties in terms of local invariants. In the analysis we include the three different ways in which the system can be biased and their effect on the generation of entangling gates. We find that, in one of the possible biasing modes, the Hamiltonian has an especially simple form, which can directly generate a wide range of different entangling gates including the iSWAP gate. Moreover, using the complete form of the Hamiltonian we find that, for any biasing mode, a CNOT gate can be generated directly.

"  The tunability of binding energies is explored by modulating a finite dielectric slab width in a planar, three dielectric system. After verifying the equivalence of the field method and method of images, three different configurations are explored for possible control of electronic binding energy: A vacuum gap between a Schottky diode, noble gas layers on a metal wall, and an electron confined between two metal plates. In each, varying the width of the finite, middle dielectric was shown to provide control over the binding energy and Bohr radius of the electron. In the case of an electron confined between two plates, it was found that the bound states smoothly connect to the box states as the gap separation was varied. Lastly, forces on the two parallel plates were examined for a possible source of significant repulsion. All numerical calculations were done in MATLAB.

"  We consider the problem of large-scale inference on the row or column variables of data in the form of a matrix. Often this data is transposable, meaning that both the row variables and column variables are of potential interest. An example of this scenario is detecting significant genes in microarrays when the samples or arrays may be dependent due to underlying relationships. We study the effect of both row and column correlations on commonly used test-statistics, null distributions, and multiple testing procedures, by explicitly modeling the covariances with the matrix-variate normal distribution. Using this model, we give both theoretical and simulation results revealing the problems associated with using standard statistical methodology on transposable data. We solve these problems by estimating the row and column covariances simultaneously, with transposable regularized covariance models, and de-correlating or sphering the data as a pre-processing step. Under reasonable assumptions, our method gives test statistics that follow the scaled theoretical null distribution and are approximately independent. Simulations based on various models with structured and observed covariances from real microarray data reveal that our method offers substantial improvements in two areas: 1) increased statistical power and 2) correct estimation of false discovery rates.

We find that the density of in-plane Bloch modes can be controlled by creating additional photon feedback from a finite-size photonic-crystal boundary that serves as a low-Q resonator. This mechanism enables significant reduction in the coupling strength between the bound state and the extended Bloch modes by more than a factor of 40.

"  In the Projector Augmented Wave (PAW) method, a local potential, basis functions, and projector functions form an All-Electron (AE) basis for valence wave functions in the application of Density Functional Theory (DFT). The construction of these potentials, basis functions and projector functions for each element can be complex, and several codes capable of utilizing the PAW method have been otherwise prevented from its use by the lack of PAW basis sets for all atoms. We have developed a procedure that improves the ease and efficiency of construction of PAW basis sets. An evolutionary algorithm is used to optimize PAW basis sets to accurately reproduce scattering properties of the atom and which converge well with respect to the energy cutoff in a planewave basis. We demonstrate the procedure for the case of Ga with the 4s, 4p, and 3d electrons treated as valence. Calculations with this Ga PAW basis set are efficient and reproduce results of linearized augmented plane wave (LAPW) calculations. We also discuss the relationship between total energy convergence with respect to the energy cutoff and the magnitude of the matching radius of the PAW set.

"  Point cloud completion aims to infer the complete geometries for missing regions of 3D objects from incomplete ones. Previous methods usually predict the complete point cloud based on the global shape representation extracted from the incomplete input. However, the global representation often suffers from the information loss of structure details on local regions of incomplete point cloud. To address this problem, we propose Skip-Attention Network (SA-Net) for 3D point cloud completion. Our main contributions lie in the following two-folds. First, we propose a skip-attention mechanism to effectively exploit the local structure details of incomplete point clouds during the inference of missing parts. The skip-attention mechanism selectively conveys geometric information from the local regions of incomplete point clouds for the generation of complete ones at different resolutions, where the skip-attention reveals the completion process in an interpretable way. Second, in order to fully utilize the selected geometric information encoded by skip-attention mechanism at different resolutions, we propose a novel structure-preserving decoder with hierarchical folding for complete shape generation. The hierarchical folding preserves the structure of complete point cloud generated in upper layer by progressively detailing the local regions, using the skip-attentioned geometry at the same resolution. We conduct comprehensive experiments on ShapeNet and KITTI datasets, which demonstrate that the proposed SA-Net outperforms the state-of-the-art point cloud completion methods.

"  We report simulation results of skyrmions on fluctuating 2D lattices, where the vertices ${\bf r}_i (\in {\bf R}^3)$ are treated as a dynamical variable and, hence, there is no crystalline structure. On the fluctuating surfaces, an external magnetic field perpendicular to the surface, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya and ferromagnetic interactions are assumed in addition to the Helfrich-Polyakov Hamiltonian for membranes. The surface (or frame) tension $\tau$ is calculated under both isotropic and uniaxial strain conditions, and this calculation clarifies a non-trivial dependence of $\tau$ on the skyrmion, stripe, and ferromagnetic phases. We find that the variation of $\tau$ with respect to the applied magnetic field in the skyrmion phase is accompanied by a variation of the total number of skyrmions. Moreover, we find that this total number variation is qualitatively consistent with a recent experimental result for the creation/annihilation of skyrmions of 3D crystalline material under uniaxial stress conditions. It is also found that the stripe phase is significantly influenced by uniaxial strains, while the skyrmion phase remains unchanged. These results allow us to conclude that the skyrmion phase is stable even on fluctuating surfaces. ",Skyrmions on 2D Elastic Surfaces with Fixed Boundary Frame

"  Data augmentation promises to alleviate data scarcity. This is most important in cases where the initial data is in short supply. This is, for existing methods, also where augmenting is the most difficult, as learning the full data distribution is impossible. For natural language, sentence editing offers a solution - relying on small but meaningful changes to the original ones. Learning which changes are meaningful also requires large amounts of training data. We thus aim to learn this in a source domain where data is abundant and apply it in a different, target domain, where data is scarce - cross-domain augmentation.   We create the Edit-transformer, a Transformer-based sentence editor that is significantly faster than the state of the art and also works cross-domain. We argue that, due to its structure, the Edit-transformer is better suited for cross-domain environments than its edit-based predecessors. We show this performance gap on the Yelp-Wikipedia domain pairs. Finally, we show that due to this cross-domain performance advantage, the Edit-transformer leads to meaningful performance gains in several downstream tasks.

"  The mass-luminosity (M-L), mass-radius (M-R) and mass-effective temperature ($M-T_{eff}$) diagrams for a subset of galactic nearby main-sequence stars with masses and radii accurate to $\leq 3\%$ and luminosities accurate to $\leq 30\%$ (268 stars) has led to a putative discovery. Four distinct mass domains have been identified, which we have tentatively associated with low, intermediate, high, and very high mass main-sequence stars, but which nevertheless are clearly separated by three distinct break points at 1.05, 2.4, and 7$M_{\odot}$ within the mass range studied of $0.38-32M_{\odot}$. Further, a revised mass-luminosity relation (MLR) is found based on linear fits for each of the mass domains identified. The revised, mass-domain based MLRs, which are classical ($L \propto M^{\alpha}$), are shown to be preferable to a single linear, quadratic or cubic equation representing as an alternative MLR. Stellar radius evolution within the main-sequence for stars with $M>1M_{\odot}$ is clearly evident on the M-R diagram, but it is not the clear on the $M-T_{eff}$ diagram based on published temperatures. Effective temperatures can be calculated directly using the well-known Stephan-Boltzmann law by employing the accurately known values of M and R with the newly defined MLRs. With the calculated temperatures, stellar temperature evolution within the main-sequence for stars with $M>1M_{\odot}$ is clearly visible on the $M-T_{eff}$ diagram. Our study asserts that it is now possible to compute the effective temperature of a main-sequence star with an accuracy of $\sim 6\%$, as long as its observed radius error is adequately small (<1%) and its observed mass error is reasonably small (<6%).

"  Computational chemistry is a scientific field within which the computer is a pivotal element. This scientific community emerged in the 1980s and was involved with two major industries: the computer manufacturers and the pharmaceutical industry, the latter becoming a potential market for the former through molecular modeling software packages. We aim to address the difficult relationships between scientific modeling methods and the software implementing these methods throughout the 1990s. Developing, using, licensing, and distributing software leads to multiple tensions among the actors in intertwined academic and industrial contexts. The Computational Chemistry mailing List (CCL), created in 1991, constitutes a valuable corpus for revealing the tensions associated with software within the community. We analyze in detail two flame wars that exemplify these tensions. We conclude that models and software must be addressed together.

"  Combining first-order logic and probability has long been a goal of AI. Markov logic (Richardson & Domingos, 2006) accomplishes this by attaching weights to first-order formulas and viewing them as templates for features of Markov networks. Unfortunately, it does not have the full power of first-order logic, because it is only defined for finite domains. This paper extends Markov logic to infinite domains, by casting it in the framework of Gibbs measures (Georgii, 1988). We show that a Markov logic network (MLN) admits a Gibbs measure as long as each ground atom has a finite number of neighbors. Many interesting cases fall in this category. We also show that an MLN admits a unique measure if the weights of its non-unit clauses are small enough. We then examine the structure of the set of consistent measures in the non-unique case. Many important phenomena, including systems with phase transitions, are represented by MLNs with non-unique measures. We relate the problem of satisfiability in first-order logic to the properties of MLN measures, and discuss how Markov logic relates to previous infinite models. ",Markov Logic in Infinite Domains
"  We present a new method to capture detailed human motion, sampling more than 1000 unique points on the body. Our method outputs highly accurate 4D (spatio-temporal) point coordinates and, crucially, automatically assigns a unique label to each of the points. The locations and unique labels of the points are inferred from individual 2D input images only, without relying on temporal tracking or any human body shape or skeletal kinematics models. Therefore, our captured point trajectories contain all of the details from the input images, including motion due to breathing, muscle contractions and flesh deformation, and are well suited to be used as training data to fit advanced models of the human body and its motion. The key idea behind our system is a new type of motion capture suit which contains a special pattern with checkerboard-like corners and two-letter codes. The images from our multi-camera system are processed by a sequence of neural networks which are trained to localize the corners and recognize the codes, while being robust to suit stretching and self-occlusions of the body. Our system relies only on standard RGB or monochrome sensors and fully passive lighting and the passive suit, making our method easy to replicate, deploy and use.

The feasible solutions of the problem are the node-weights such that the activated edges form graphs of required connectivity, and the objective is to find a feasible solution minimizing its total weight. In this paper, we consider a prize-collecting version of the network activation problem, and present first non- trivial approximation algorithms.

They round optimal solutions for the relaxation by repeatedly computing node-weights activating subgraphs called spiders, which are known to be useful for approximating the network activation problem.

"  Recently we have studied, using numerical simulations, a limited valency model, i.e. an attractive square well model with a constraint on the maximum number of bonded neighbors. Studying a large region of temperatures $T$ and packing fractions $\phi$, we have estimated the location of the liquid-gas phase separation spinodal and the loci of dynamic arrest, where the system is trapped in a disordered non-ergodic state. Two distinct arrest lines for the system are present in the system: a {\it (repulsive) glass} line at high packing fraction, and a {\it gel} line at low $\phi$ and $T$. The former is essentially vertical ($\phi$-controlled), while the latter is rather horizontal ($T$-controlled) in the $(\phi-T)$ plane. We here complement the molecular dynamics results with mode coupling theory calculations, using the numerical structure factors as input. We find that the theory predicts a repulsive glass line -- in satisfactory agreement with the simulation results -- and an attractive glass line which appears to be unrelated to the gel line.

"  We consider the revenue maximization problem of a monopolist via a non-Myersonian approach that could generalize to multiple items and multiple buyers. Although such an approach does not lead to any closed-form solution of the problem, it does provide some insights into this problem from different angles. In particular, we consider both Bayesian (Bayesian Incentive Compatible + Bayesian Individually Rational) and Dominant-Strategy (Dominant-Strategy Incentive Compatible + ex-post Individually Rational) implementations, where all the buyers have additive valuations and quasi-linear utilities and all the valuations are independent across buyers (not necessarily independent across items).   The main technique of our approach is to formulate the problem as an LP (probably with exponential size) and apply primal-dual analysis. We observe that any optimal solution of the dual program naturally defines the virtual value functions for the primal revenue maximization problem in the sense that any revenue-maximizing auction must be a virtual welfare maximizer (cf. Myerson's auction for a single item [Myerson, 1981]).   Based on this observation, we characterize a sufficient and necessary condition for BIC = DSIC, i.e., the optimal revenue of Bayesian implementations equals to the optimal revenue of dominant-strategy implementations (BRev = DRev). The condition is if and only if the optimal DSIC revenue DRev can be achieved by a DSIC and ex-post IR virtual welfare maximizer with buyer-independent virtual value functions (buyer i's virtual value is independent of other buyers' valuations). In light of the characterization, we further show that when all the valuations are i.i.d., it is further equivalent to that separate-selling is optimal. In particular, it respects one result from the recent breakthrough work on the exact optimal solutions in the multi-item multi-buyer setting by Yao [2016].

"  This article discussesl a few of the problems that arise in geophysical fluid dynamics and climate that are associated with the presence of moisture in the air, its condensation and release of latent heat. Our main focus is Earth's atmosphere but we also discuss how these problems might manifest themselves on other planetary bodies, with particular attention to Titan where methane takes on the role of water.   GFD has traditionally been concerned with understanding the very basic problems that lie at the foundation of dynamical meteorology and ocean\-ography. Conventionally, and a little ironically, the subject mainly considers `dry' fluids, meaning it does not concern itself overly much with phase changes. The subject is often regarded as dry in another way, because it does not consider problems perceived as relevant to the real world, such as clouds or rainfall, which have typically been the province of complicated numerical models. Those models often rely on parameterizations of unresolved processes, parameterizations that may work very well but that often have a semi-empirical basis. The consequent dichotomy between the foundations and the applications prevents progress being made that has both a secure basis in scientific understanding and a relevance to the Earth's climate, especially where moisture is concerned. The dichotomy also inhibits progress in understanding the climate of other planets, where observations are insufficient to tune the parameterizations that weather and climate models for Earth rely upon, and a more fundamental approach is called for. Here we discuss four diverse examples of the problems with moisture: the determination of relative humidity and cloudiness; the transport of water vapor and its possible change under global warming; the moist shallow water equations and the Madden-Julian Oscillation; and the hydrology cycle on other planetary bodies.

"  Where the doped holes reside in cuprate superconductors has crucial implications for the understanding of the mechanism responsible for their high temperature superconductivity. It has been generally assumed that doped holes reside in hybridized Cu $d_{x^2-y^2}$ - O $p\sigma$ orbitals in the $CuO_2$ planes, based on results of density functional band structure calculations. Instead, we propose that doped holes in the cuprates reside in O $p\pi$ orbitals in the plane, perpendicular to the $Cu-O$ bond, that are raised to the Fermi energy through local orbital relaxation, that is not taken into account in band structure calculations that place the bands associated with these orbitals well below the Fermi energy. We use a dynamic Hubbard model to incorporate the orbital relaxation degree of freedom and find in exact diagonalization of a small $Cu_4O_4$ cluster that holes will go to the O $p\pi$ orbitals for relaxation energies comparable to what is expected from atomic properties of oxygen anions. The bandwidth of this band becomes significantly smaller than predicted by band structure calculations due to the orbital relaxation effect. Within the theory of hole superconductivity the heavy hole carriers in this almost full band will pair and drive the system superconducting through lowering of their quantum kinetic energy.

"  Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems are considered as one of the leading technologies employed in the next generations of wireless communication networks (5G), which promise to provide higher spectral efficiency, lower latency, and more reliability. Due to the massive number of devices served by the base stations (BS) equipped with large antenna arrays, massive-MIMO systems need to perform high-dimensional signal processing in a considerably short amount of time. The computational complexity of such data processing, while satisfying the energy and latency requirements, is beyond the capabilities of the conventional widely-used digital electronics-based computing, i.e., Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). In this paper, the speed and lossless propagation of light is exploited to introduce a photonic computing approach that addresses the high computational complexity required by massive-MIMO systems. The proposed computing approach is based on photonic implementation of multiply and accumulate (MAC) operation achieved by broadcast-and-weight (B&W) architecture. The B&W protocol is limited to real and positive values to perform MAC operations. In this work, preprocessing steps are developed to enable the proposed photonic computing architecture to accept any arbitrary values as the input. This is a requirement for wireless communication systems that typically deal with complex values. Numerical analysis shows that the performance of the wireless communication system is not degraded by the proposed photonic computing architecture, while it provides significant improvements in time and energy efficiency for massive-MIMO systems as compared to the most powerful Graphics Processing Units (GPUs).

"  The plasma heating during collisionless magnetic reconnection is investigated using particle-in-cell simulations. We analyze the time evolution of the plasma temperature associated with the motion of the reconnecting flux tube, where the plasma temperature is defined as second-order moment of velocity distribution function in the simulation frame/in the center of the flux tube frame, and we show that the plasma heating during magnetic reconnection can be separated into two distinct stages: the nonadiabatic heating stage, in which the magnetic field lines are just reconnecting in the X-type diffusion region, and the adiabatic heating stage, in which the flux tube is shrinking after two flux tubes merge. During the adiabatic heating stage, the plasma temperature $T$ can be approximated by $TV^{\gamma-1}=const.$, where $\gamma=5/3$ is the specific heat, and $V$ is the volume of the flux tube. In the nonadiabatic heating stage, we found numerically that the ratio of the increment of the ion temperature to that of the electron temperature can be approximated by $\Delta T_i/\Delta T_e \approx (m_i/m_e )^{1/4}$, where $m_i$ and $m_e$ are the ion and electron mass, respectively. We also present a theoretical model based on a magnetic-diffusion-dominated reconnection to explain the simulation result.

"  In this paper, we prove the concavity of the Shannon entropy power for the heat equation associated with the Laplacian or the Witten Laplacian on complete Riemannian manifolds with suitable curvature-dimension condition and on compact super Ricci flows. Under suitable curvature-dimension condition, we prove that the rigidity models of the Shannon entropy power are Einstein or quasi Einstein manifolds with Hessian solitons. Moreover, we prove the convexity of the Shannon entropy power for the conjugate heat equation introduced by G. Perelman on Ricci flow and that the corresponding rigidity models are the shrinking Ricci solitons. As an application, we prove the entropy isoperimetric inequality on complete Riemannian manifolds with non-negative (Bakry-Emery) Ricci curvature and the maximal volume growth condition.

"  The influence has been studied of the ionization laser polarization on the effective temperature of an ultracold electron source, which is based on near-threshold photoionization. This source is capable of producing both high-intensity and high-coherence electron pulses, with applications in for example electron diffraction experiments. For both nanosecond and femtosecond photoionization, a sinusoidal dependence of the temperature on polarization angle has been found. For most experimental conditions, the temperature is minimal when the polarization coincides with the direction of acceleration. However, surprisingly, for nanosecond ionization a regime exists when the temperature is minimal when the polarization is perpendicular to the acceleration direction. This shows that in order to create electron bunches with the highest transverse coherence length, it is important to control the polarization of the ionization laser. The general trends and magnitudes of the temperature measurements are described by a model, based on the analysis of classical electron trajectories; this model further deepens our understanding of the internal mechanisms during the photoionization process. Furthermore, for nanosecond ionization, charge oscillations as a function of laser polarization have been observed; for most situations the oscillation amplitude is small.

"  This paper is devoted to the study of tilt stability in finite dimensional optimization via the approach of using the subgradient graphical derivative. We establish a new characterization of tilt-stable local minimizers for a broad class of unconstrained optimization problems in terms of a uniform positive definiteness of the subgradient graphical derivative of the objective function around the point in question. By applying this result to nonlinear programming under the metric subregularity constraint qualification, we derive a second-order characterization and several new sufficient conditions for tilt stability. In particular, we show that each stationary point of a nonlinear programming problem satisfying the metric subregularity constraint qualification is a tilt-stable local minimizer if the classical strong second-order sufficient condition holds.

"  We study through the time evolution of magnetization the low temperature (T) dynamics of the metastable coexisting phases created by traversing different paths in magnetic field (H) and T space in a shape memory alloy system, Ni$_{45}$Co$_{5}$Mn$_{38}$Sn$_{12}$. It is shown that these coexisting phases consisting of a fraction of kinetically arrested austenite phase and remaining fraction of low-T equilibrium martensitic phase undergo a slow relaxation to low magnetization (martensitic) state but with very different thermomagnetic history-dependent rates at the same T and H. We discovered that, when the nucleation of martensitic phase is initiated at much lower T through the de-arrest of the glass like arrested state contrasted with the respective first order transformation (through supercooling at much higher T), then the long time relaxation rate scales with the non-equilibrium phase fraction but has a very weak dependence on T. This is explained on the basis of the H-T path dependent size of the critical radii of the nuclei and the subsequent growth of the equilibrium phase through the motion of the interface.

"  We present a study of compact star clusters in the nearby pair of interacting galaxies NGC 5194/95 (M51), based on multifilter Hubble Space Telescope WFPC2 archival images. We have detected ~400 isolated clusters. Our requirement that clusters be detected based only on their morphology results in the selection of relatively isolated objects, and we estimate that we are missing the majority (by a factor 4-6) of <10 Myr clusters due to crowding. Hence we focus on the cluster population older than 10 Myr. An age distribution shows a broad peak between 100-500 Myr, which is consistent with the crossing times of NGC 5195 through the NGC 5194 disk estimated in both single and multiple-passage dynamical models. We estimate that the peak contains approximately 2.2-2.5 times more clusters than expected from a constant rate of cluster formation over this time interval. We estimate the effective radii of our sample clusters and find a median value of 3-4 pc. Additionally, we see correlations of increasing cluster size with cluster mass (with a best fit slope of 0.14\pm0.03) at the 4sigma level, and with cluster age (0.06\pm0.02) at the 3sigma level. Finally, we report for the first time the discovery of faint, extended star clusters in the companion, NGC 5195, an SB0 galaxy. These have red [(V-I)>1.0] colors, effective radii >7 pc, and are scattered over the disk of NGC 5195.

We obtain the expected behavior $Z \propto \sqrt{T_F}$ at unitarity, together with the recently measured proportionality constant.

"  We examine the time evolution of the D=d+4 dimensional Einstein field equations subjected to a flat Robertson-Walker metric where the 3D and higher-dimensional scale factors are allowed to evolve at different rates. We find the exact solution to these equations for a single fluid component, which yields two limiting regimes offering the 3D scale factor as a function of the time. The fluid regime solution closely mimics that described by 4D FRW cosmology, offering a late-time behavior for the 3D scale factor after becoming valid in the early universe, and can give rise to a late-time accelerated expansion driven by vacuum energy. This is shown to be preceded by an earlier volume regime solution, which offers a very early-time epoch of accelerated expansion for a radiation-dominated universe for d=1. The time scales describing these phenomena, including the transition from volume to fluid regime, are shown to fall within a small fraction of the first second when the fundamental constants of the theory are aligned with the Planck time. This model potentially offers a higher-dimensional alternative to scalar-field inflationary theory and a consistent cosmological theory, yielding a unified description of early- and late-time accelerated expansions via a 5D spacetime scenario.

Such argument is standard in the study of nonlinear Schr\""odinger equations but it seems to be the first time to be applied to QW. We also numerically study the dynamics of QW and observe soliton like solutions. ",On nonlinear scattering for quantum walks
"  We consider a dilute granular gas of hard spheres colliding inelastically with coefficients of normal and tangential restitution $\alpha$ and $\beta$, respectively. The basic quantities characterizing the distribution function $f(\mathbf{v},\bm{\omega})$ of linear ($\mathbf{v}$) and angular ($\bm{\omega}$) velocities are the second-degree moments defining the translational ($T^\text{tr}$) and rotational ($T^\text{rot}$) temperatures. The deviation of $f$ from the Maxwellian distribution parameterized by $T^\text{tr}$ and $T^\text{rot}$ can be measured by the cumulants associated with the fourth-degree velocity moments. The main objective of this paper is the evaluation of the collisional rates of change of these second- and fourth-degree moments by means of a Sonine approximation. The results are subsequently applied to the computation of the temperature ratio $T^\text{rot}/T^\text{tr}$ and the cumulants of two paradigmatic states: the homogeneous cooling state and the homogeneous steady state driven by a white-noise stochastic thermostat. It is found in both cases that the Maxwellian approximation for the temperature ratio does not deviate much from the Sonine prediction. On the other hand, non-Maxwellian properties measured by the cumulants cannot be ignored, especially in the homogeneous cooling state for medium and small roughness. In that state, moreover, the cumulant directly related to the translational velocity differs in the quasi-smooth limit $\beta\to -1$ from that of pure smooth spheres ($\beta=-1$). This singular behavior is directly related to the unsteady character of the homogeneous cooling state and thus it is absent in the stochastic thermostat case.

"  Massively multilingual transformers pretrained with language modeling objectives (e.g., mBERT, XLM-R) have become a de facto default transfer paradigm for zero-shot cross-lingual transfer in NLP, offering unmatched transfer performance. Current downstream evaluations, however, verify their efficacy predominantly in transfer settings involving languages with sufficient amounts of pretraining data, and with lexically and typologically close languages. In this work, we analyze their limitations and show that cross-lingual transfer via massively multilingual transformers, much like transfer via cross-lingual word embeddings, is substantially less effective in resource-lean scenarios and for distant languages. Our experiments, encompassing three lower-level tasks (POS tagging, dependency parsing, NER), as well as two high-level semantic tasks (NLI, QA), empirically correlate transfer performance with linguistic similarity between the source and target languages, but also with the size of pretraining corpora of target languages. We also demonstrate a surprising effectiveness of inexpensive few-shot transfer (i.e., fine-tuning on a few target-language instances after fine-tuning in the source) across the board. This suggests that additional research efforts should be invested to reach beyond the limiting zero-shot conditions.

"  Often, data contains only composite events composed of multiple events, some observed and some unobserved. For example, search ad click is observed by a brand, whereas which customers were shown a search ad - an actionable variable - is often not observed. In such cases, inference is not possible on unobserved event. This occurs when a marketing action is taken over earned and paid digital channels. Similar setting arises in numerous datasets where multiple actors interact. One approach is to use the composite event as a proxy for the unobserved event of interest. However, this leads to invalid inference. This paper takes a direct approach whereby an event of interest is identified based on information on the composite event and aggregate data on composite events (e.g. total number of search ads shown). This work contributes to the literature by proving identification of the unobserved events' probabilities up to a scalar factor under mild condition. We propose an approach to identify the scalar factor by using aggregate data that is usually available from earned and paid channels. The factor is identified by adding a loss term to the usual cross-entropy loss. We validate the approach on three synthetic datasets. In addition, the approach is validated on a real marketing problem where some observed events are hidden from the algorithm for validation. The proposed modification to the cross-entropy loss function improves the average performance by 46%. ",Split: Inferring Unobserved Event Probabilities for Disentangling   Brand-Customer Interactions
"  The B-meson light-cone wavefunctions, $\Psi_{\pm}(\omega,z^2)$, are investigated up to the next-to-leading order in Fock state expansion in the heavy quark limit. In order to know the transverse momentum dependence of the B-meson wavefunctions with 3-particle Fock states' contributions, we make use of the relations between 2- and 3- particle wavefunctions derived from the QCD equations of motion and the heavy quark symmetry, especially two constraints derived from the gauge field equation of motion are employed. Our results show that the use of gluon equation of motion can give a constraint on the transverse momentum dependence $\chi(\omega,\mathbf{k}_\perp)$ of the B-meson wavefunctions, whose distribution tends to be a hyperbola-like curve under the condition $0<c_1<1$, which is quite different from the WW type wavefunctions, whose transverse momentum dependence $\chi^{WW}(\omega,\mathbf{k}_\perp)$ is merely a delta function.

"  Crowdsourcing system has emerged as an effective platform to label data with relatively low cost by using non-expert workers. However, inferring correct labels from multiple noisy answers on data has been a challenging problem, since the quality of answers varies widely across tasks and workers. Many previous works have assumed a simple model where the order of workers in terms of their reliabilities is fixed across tasks, and focused on estimating the worker reliabilities to aggregate answers with different weights. We propose a highly general $d$-type worker-task specialization model in which the reliability of each worker can change depending on the type of a given task, where the number $d$ of types can scale in the number of tasks. In this model, we characterize the optimal sample complexity to correctly infer labels with any given recovery accuracy, and propose an inference algorithm achieving the order-wise optimal bound. We conduct experiments both on synthetic and real-world datasets, and show that our algorithm outperforms the existing algorithms developed based on strict model assumptions.

"  Based on modern quantum measurement theory, we use Zurek's ""triple model"" to study, from the viewpoint of quantum information theory, the wave and particle nature of a photon in a symmetric Mach-Zehnder interferometer. In the process of quantum measurement, the state of both the system and the detector is not an entangled state but a correlated state. We find that the information gain about the photon is related to the correlations (including classical and quantum correlations) between the photon and the detector. We also derive the relationship between the information gain and the fringe visibility. We find that the classical correlations remain consistent with the path distinguishability and can be used to describe the particle-like property of the photon. Quantum correlations are not exactly the same as fringe visibility, but both can represent the quantum coherence of the photon. Finally, we provide an analytical expression for quantum correlations of one type of two-qubit separable states. ",Information gain versus interference in Bohr's principle of   complementarity
"  Electroencephalograms (EEG) are noninvasive measurement signals of electrical neuronal activity in the brain. One of the current major statistical challenges is formally measuring functional dependency between those complex signals. This paper, proposes the spectral causality model (SCAU), a robust linear model, under a causality paradigm, to reflect inter- and intra-frequency modulation effects that cannot be identifiable using other methods. SCAU inference is conducted with three main steps: (a) signal decomposition into frequency bins, (b) intermediate spectral band mapping, and (c) dependency modeling through frequency-specific autoregressive models (VAR). We apply SCAU to study complex dependencies during visual and lexical fluency tasks (word generation and visual fixation) in 26 participants' EEGs. We compared the connectivity networks estimated using SCAU with respect to a VAR model. SCAU networks show a clear contrast for both stimuli while the magnitude links also denoted a low variance in comparison with the VAR networks. Furthermore, SCAU dependency connections not only were consistent with findings in the neuroscience literature, but it also provided further evidence on the directionality of the spatio-spectral dependencies such as the delta-originated and theta-induced links in the fronto-temporal brain network.

"  We consider a class of groups $V_n(G)$ which are supergroups of the Higman-Thompson groups $V_n$. These groups fit in a framework of Elizabeth Scott for generating infinite virtually simple groups, and the groups we study in particular are initially introduced by Farley and Hughes. The group $V_n(G)$ is the result one obtains by taking the $V_n$ generators and adding a tree automorphism for each generator of a subgroup $G$ of the symmetric group on $n$ letters, where the new generators each permute the child leaves of a specific vertex $\alpha$ of the infinite rooted $n$-ary tree according to the permutation they represent, and then they iterate this permutation again at each vertex which is a descendent of $\alpha$.   Farley and Hughes show that $V_n(G)$ is not isomorphic to $V_n$ when $G$ fails to act freely on the points $\{1,2,...,n\}$, and expect further non-isomorphism results in the other cases. We show the perhaps surprising result that if $G$ does act freely, then $V_n(G)\cong V_n$. We also generalise these results and produce some examples of even more isomorphisms amongst groups in the family $V_n(G)$.

"  We analyse within the ""flavoured"" leptogenesis scenario of baryon asymmetry generation, the interplay of the ""low energy"" CP-violation, originating from the PMNS neutrino mixing matrix $U$, and the ""high energy"" CP-violation which can be present in the matrix of neutrino Yukawa couplings, $\lambda$, and can manifest itself only in ""high"" energy scale processes. The type I see-saw model with three heavy right-handed Majorana neutrinos having hierarchical spectrum is considered.

In the case of Seiberg-Witten theory the gravitational corrections can be expressed in closed form as quasimodular functions of Gamma(2). In the matrix model we fix the holomorphic ambiguity up to genus two.

"  To optimize a neural network one often thinks of optimizing its parameters, but it is ultimately a matter of optimizing the function that maps inputs to outputs. Since a change in the parameters might serve as a poor proxy for the change in the function, it is of some concern that primacy is given to parameters but that the correspondence has not been tested. Here, we show that it is simple and computationally feasible to calculate distances between functions in a $L^2$ Hilbert space. We examine how typical networks behave in this space, and compare how parameter $\ell^2$ distances compare to function $L^2$ distances between various points of an optimization trajectory. We find that the two distances are nontrivially related. In particular, the $L^2/\ell^2$ ratio decreases throughout optimization, reaching a steady value around when test error plateaus. We then investigate how the $L^2$ distance could be applied directly to optimization. We first propose that in multitask learning, one can avoid catastrophic forgetting by directly limiting how much the input/output function changes between tasks. Secondly, we propose a new learning rule that constrains the distance a network can travel through $L^2$-space in any one update. This allows new examples to be learned in a way that minimally interferes with what has previously been learned. These applications demonstrate how one can measure and regularize function distances directly, without relying on parameters or local approximations like loss curvature.

"  In this paper, we consider the fault-tolerant $k$-median problem and give the \emph{first} constant factor approximation algorithm for it. In the fault-tolerant generalization of classical $k$-median problem, each client $j$ needs to be assigned to at least $r_j \ge 1$ distinct open facilities. The service cost of $j$ is the sum of its distances to the $r_j$ facilities, and the $k$-median constraint restricts the number of open facilities to at most $k$. Previously, a constant factor was known only for the special case when all $r_j$s are the same, and a logarithmic approximation ratio for the general case. In addition, we present the first polynomial time algorithm for the fault-tolerant $k$-median problem on a path or a HST by showing that the corresponding LP always has an integral optimal solution.   We also consider the fault-tolerant facility location problem, where the service cost of $j$ can be a weighted sum of its distance to the $r_j$ facilities.

The static and dynamical properties of the droplet can be described qualitatively by the effective Ginzburg-Landau field theory with cubic-quintic nonlinearities, where the attractive cubic nonlinearlity emerges although all the bare interparticle interactions are repulsive.

"  We find that tunnel junctions are not needed to provide single electron effects in a metallic island. Eventually the tunnel junction may be replaced by an arbitrary scatterer. It is important that even a {\it diffusive} scatterer provides a sufficient isolation for single electron effects to persist. To formulate this in exact terms, we derive and analyze the effective action that describes an arbitrary scatterer. We also consider the fluctuations of the effective charging energy.

  Dimensional dependence of thermal conductance at low temperatures in nanowires is studied using the nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) method. Our calculation shows a smooth dimensional crossover of thermal conductance in nanowire from one-dimensional to three-dimensional behavior with the increase of diameters. The results are consistent with the experimental findings that the temperature dependence of thermal conductance at low temperature for diameters from tens to hundreds nanometers will be close to Debye law. The calculation also suggests that universal thermal conductance is only observable in nanowires with small diameters. We also find that the interfacial thermal conductance across Si and Ge nanowire is much lower than the corresponding value in bulk materials. ,Dimensional crossover of thermal conductance in nanowires

These are due to the subprocesses in which a charm quark loop interacts with a self-consistently produced background static QCD field.

"  A recent analysis of the methods by which higher-level gauge symmetries are realized in string theory has made it possible to systematically obtain new constraints on string GUT model-building. In this paper, we perform such a study for the case of SO(10) free-field string GUT models, and find a number of significant new results. First, we show that within the conventional string models using the so-called ``diagonal'' embeddings, all representations larger than the 16 must always transform as singlets under all gauge symmetries beyond SO(10). This includes the 45 and 54 representations, and holds regardless of the affine level at which SO(10) is realized. Furthermore, we show that such constructions can never give rise to the 120, 126, or 144 representations of SO(10) --- again regardless of the affine level. We also perform a similar analysis for E_6, and find that the adjoint 78 representation must always transform as a singlet under all gauge symmetries beyond E_6; moreover, all representations beyond the 78 representation are prohibited. Taken together, these results thus severely limit the types of phenomenologically realistic field-theoretic SO(10) and E_6 models that can be obtained using such string constructions. Finally, we also explore the possibility of using non-diagonal free-field embeddings, and show that in the SO(10) case such embeddings may have improved phenomenological prospects.

"  We review the potential of long and intermediate baseline reactor neutrino experiments in measuring the mass and mixing parameters. The KamLAND experiment can measure the solar mass squared difference very precisely. However it is not at the ideal baseline for measuring the solar neutrino mixing angle. If low-LMA is confirmed by the next results from KamLAND, a reactor experiment with a baseline of 70 km should be ideal to measure precisely the solar neutrino mixing angle. If on the contrary KamLAND re-establishes high-LMA as a viable solution, then a 20--30 km intermediate baseline reactor experiment could yield very rich phenomenology.

"  Simultaneously information and power transfer in mobile relay networks have recently emerged, where the relay can harvest the radio frequency (RF) energy and then use this energy for data forwarding and system operation. Most of the previous works do not consider that the relay may have its own objectives, such as using the harvested energy for its own transmission instead of maximizing transmission of the network. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a Nash bargaining approach to balance the information transmission efficiency of source-destination pairs and the harvested energy of the relay in a wireless powered relay network with multiple source-destination pairs and one relay. We analyze and prove that the Nash bargaining problem has several desirable properties such as the discreteness and quasi-concavity, when it is decomposed into three sub-problems: the energy transmission power optimization, the power control for data transmission and the time division between energy transmission and data transmission. Based on the theoretical analysis, we propose an alternating power control and time division algorithm to find a suboptimal solution. Simulation results clearly show and demonstrate the properties of the problem and the convergence of our algorithm.

"  The Riemannian product $\mathbb M_1(c_1) \times \mathbb M_2(c_2)$, where $\mathbb M_i(c_i)$ denotes the $2$-dimensional space form of constant sectional curvature $c_i \in \mathbb R$, has two different Spin$^c$ structures carrying each a parallel spinor. The restriction of these two parallel spinor fields to a $3$-dimensional hypersurface $M$ characterizes the isometric immersion of $M$ into $\mathbb M_1(c_1) \times \mathbb M_2(c_2)$.

"  It has been proposed recently that interacting Symmetry Protected Topological (SPT) phases can be classified using cobordism theory. We test this proposal in the case of fermionic SPT phases with Z/2 symmetry, where Z/2 is either time-reversal or an internal symmetry.

"  In this work we tie concepts derived from statistical mechanics, information theory and contact Riemannian geometry within a single consistent formalism for thermodynamic fluctuation theory. We derive the concrete relations characterizing the geometry of the Thermodynamic Phase Space stemming from the relative entropy and the Fisher-Rao information matrix. In particular, we show that the Thermodynamic Phase Space is endowed with a natural para-contact pseudo-Riemannian structure derived from a statistical moment expansion which is para-Sasaki and {\eta}-Einstein. Moreover, we prove that such manifold is locally isomorphic to the hyperbolic Heisenberg group. In this way we show that the hyperbolic geometry and the Heisenberg commutation relations on the phase space naturally emerge from classical statistical mechanics. Finally, we argue on the possible implications of our results. ",Para-Sasakian geometry in thermodynamic fluctuation theory
"  We present the nonuniform distribution of temperature and abundance in the angular extent of 10'(1.4 Mpc) in A1650 observed by XMM-Newton. Spectral analysis was carried out in 19 systematically-subdivided regions, and in 15 specified regions referred to the hardness ratio (HR) map. The value of HR, defined as the ratio of counts in the 1.6-10 keV band to those in the 0.8-1.6 keV, is an indicator to investigate the spatial variation of spectral features. The temperature and abundance were obtained to be 4-6 keV and 0.2-0.5 solar value with average values of 5.62+0.05-0.07 keV and 0.36+0.02-0.01 solar value within a radius of 5', respectively. The redshift was derived to be 8.01+0.02-0.02x10^-2 against an optical value of 8.45x10^-2. It turned out that cool regions with a temperature of around 4 keV and a scalelength of a few 100 kpc are patchily distributed in the outer envelope. This temperature structure could be explained by the infalling of groups of galaxies into the cluster main body. More than 30 point sources were found around A1650 in the FOV of 30'.

"  Increased stress, fuel consumption, air pollution, accidents and delays are some of the consequences of traffic congestion usually incurring in tremendous economic impacts, which society aims to remedy in order to leverage a sustainable development. Recently, unconventional means for modeling and controlling such complex traffic systems relying on multi-agent systems have arisen. This paper contributes to the understanding of such complex and highly dynamic systems by proposing an open-source tool-chain to implement multi-agent-based solutions in traffic and transportation. The proposed approach relies on two very popular tools in both domains, with focus on traffic light control. This tool-chain consists in combining JADE (Java Agent DEvelopment Framework), for the implementation of multi-agent systems, with SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility), for the microscopic simulation of traffic interactions. TraSMAPI (Traffic Simulation Manager Application Programming Interface) is used to combine JADE and SUMO allowing communication between them. A demonstration of the concept is presented to illustrate the main features of this tool-chain, using Q-Learning as the reinforcement learning method for each traffic light agent in a simulated network.

"  The mobility behavior of human beings is predictable to a varying degree e.g. depending on the traits of their personality such as the trait extraversion - introversion: the mobility of introvert users may be more dominated by routines and habitual movement patterns, resulting in a more predictable mobility behavior on the basis of their own location history while, in contrast, extrovert users get about a lot and are explorative by nature, which may hamper the prediction of their mobility. However, socially more active and extrovert users meet more people and share information, experiences, believes, thoughts etc. with others. which in turn leads to a high interdependency between their mobility and social lives.

"  Sentiment analysis is a highly subjective and challenging task. Its complexity further increases when applied to the Arabic language, mainly because of the large variety of dialects that are unstandardized and widely used in the Web, especially in social media. While many datasets have been released to train sentiment classifiers in Arabic, most of these datasets contain shallow annotation, only marking the sentiment of the text unit, as a word, a sentence or a document. In this paper, we present the Arabic Sentiment Twitter Dataset for the Levantine dialect (ArSenTD-LEV). Based on findings from analyzing tweets from the Levant region, we created a dataset of 4,000 tweets with the following annotations: the overall sentiment of the tweet, the target to which the sentiment was expressed, how the sentiment was expressed, and the topic of the tweet. Results confirm the importance of these annotations at improving the performance of a baseline sentiment classifier.

"  We present total and polarized intensity images of 15 active galactic nuclei obtained with the Very Long Baseline Array at 7 mm at 17 epochs from 1998 March to 2001 April. At some epochs the images are accompanied by nearly simultaneous polarization measurements at 3 mm, 1.35/0.85 mm, and optical wavelengths. Here we analyze the 7 mm images to define the properties of the jets of two radio galaxies, five BL Lac objects, and eight quasars on angular scales $\gtrsim 0.1$ milliarcseconds. We determine the apparent velocities of 106 features in the jets; for many of the features we derive Doppler factors using a new method based on comparison of timescale of decline in flux density with the light-travel time across the emitting region. This allows us to estimate the Lorentz factors, intrinsic brightness temperatures, and viewing angles of 73 superluminal knots, as well as the opening angle of the jet for each source. We analyze the derived physical parameters of the jets. In nine sources we detect statistically meaningful deviations from ballistic motion, with the majority of components accelerating with distance from the core. In six sources we identify jet features with characteristics of trailing shocks that form behind the primary strong perturbations in jet simulations. The apparent speeds of these components increase with distance from the core suggesting an acceleration of the underlying jet.

"  Remembering an event is affected by personal emotional status. We examined the psychological status and personal factors; depression (Center for Epidemiological Studies - Depression, Radloff, 1977), present affective (Positive Affective and Negative Affective Schedule, Watson et al., 1988), life orient (Life Orient Test, Scheier & Carver, 1985), self-awareness (Core Self Evaluation Scale, Judge et al., 2003), and social factor (Social Support, Sarason et al., 1983) of undergraduate students (N=64) and got summaries of a story, Chronicle of a Death Foretold (Gabriel Garcia Marquez, 1981) from them.

From the same vein used for transfer learning (Pan & Yang, 2010), we collected 38,265 movie review data to train the model and then use them to score summaries of each student. The results of CES-D and PANAS show the relationship between emotion and memory retrieval as follows: depressed people have shown a tendency of representing a story more negatively, and they seemed less expressive. People with full of emotion - high in PANAS - have retrieved their memory more expressively than others, using more negative words then others. The contributions of this study can be summarized as follows: First, lightening the relationship between emotion and its effect during times of storing or retrieving a memory. Second, suggesting objective methods to evaluate the intensity of emotion in natural language format, using a sentimental analysis model.

"  In this work we present a formalism to describe non equilibrium conditions in systems with a discretized energy spectrum, such as quantum systems. We develop a formalism based on a combination of Gibbs-Shannon entropy and information thermodynamics that arrives to a generalization of the De-Brujin identity applicable to discrete and non-symmetric distributions. This allows to define the concept of a thermodynamic temperature with a different, albeit complementary meaning to the equilibrium kinetic temperature of a system. The theory is applied to Bosonic and Fermionic cases represented by an harmonic oscillator and a single energy state, respectively. We show that the formalism correctly recovers known results at equilibrium, then we demonstrate an application to a genuine non equilibrium state: a coherent quantum oscillator.

"  We present numerical investigations into three principal properties of the small-scale dynamo in stably stratified turbulence: the onset criterion, the growth rate, and the nature of the magnetic field anisotropy in the kinematic regime. The results suggest that all three dynamo properties are controlled by the scale separation between the Ozmidov scale and the viscous or resistive scale. In addition to the critical magnetic Reynolds number, this allows for the definition of critical buoyancy and magnetic buoyancy Reynolds numbers for stratified small-scale dynamo onset in the high and low magnetic Prandtl number regimes, respectively. The presence of a small-scale dynamo in stellar radiative zones could affect dynamics through resulting Maxwell stresses and/or influence large-scale dynamo mechanisms in regions of differential rotation. Taking the solar radiative zone as a representative example and applying the onset criterion, we find that the stratification is strong enough to make the small-scale dynamo marginally active in the stably stratified turbulence of the solar tachocline.

"  One of the most puzzling aspects of the high $T_c$ superconductors is the appearance of Fermi arcs in the normal state of the underdoped cuprate materials. These are loci of low energy excitations covering part of the fermi surface, that suddenly appear above $T_c$ instead of the nodal quasiparticles. Based on a semiclassical theory, we argue that partial Fermi surfaces arise naturally in a d-wave superconductor that is destroyed by thermal phase fluctuations. Specifically, we show that the electron spectral function develops a square root singularity at low frequencies for wave-vectors positioned on the bare Fermi surface. We predict a temperature dependence of the arc length that can partially account for results of recent angle resolved photo emission (ARPES) experiments.

"  Modern day quantum simulators can prepare a wide variety of quantum states but extracting observables from the resulting ""quantum data"" often poses a challenge. We tackle this problem by developing a quantum state tomography scheme which relies on approximating the probability distribution over the outcomes of an informationally complete measurement in a variational manifold represented by a convolutional neural network. We show an excellent representability of prototypical ground- and steady states with this ansatz using a number of variational parameters that scales polynomially in system size. This compressed representation allows us to reconstruct states with high classical fidelities outperforming standard methods such as maximum likelihood estimation. Furthermore, it achieves a reduction of the root mean square errors of observables by up to an order of magnitude compared to their direct estimation from experimental data.

"  The enormous velocities of the so called hypervelocity stars (HVSs) derive, likely, from close interactions with massive black holes, binary stars encounters or supernova explosions. In this paper, we investigate the origin of hypervelocity stars as consequence of the close interaction between the Milky Way central massive black hole and a passing-by young stellar cluster. We found that both single and binary HVSs may be generated in a burst-like event, as the cluster passes near the orbital pericentre. High velocity stars will move close to the initial cluster orbital plane and in the direction of the cluster orbital motion at the pericentre. The binary fraction of these HVS jets depends on the primordial binary fraction in the young cluster. The level of initial mass segregation determines the value of the average mass of the ejected stars. Some binary stars will merge, continuing their travel across and out of the Galaxy as blue stragglers. ",Hypervelocity stars from young stellar clusters in the Galactic Centre
"  We introduce a new arbitrary-shaped text detection approach named ReLaText by formulating text detection as a visual relationship detection problem. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new formulation, we start from using a ""link"" relationship to address the challenging text-line grouping problem firstly. The key idea is to decompose text detection into two subproblems, namely detection of text primitives and prediction of link relationships between nearby text primitive pairs. Specifically, an anchor-free region proposal network based text detector is first used to detect text primitives of different scales from different feature maps of a feature pyramid network, from which a text primitive graph is constructed by linking each pair of nearby text primitives detected from a same feature map with an edge. Then, a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) based link relationship prediction module is used to prune wrongly-linked edges in the text primitive graph to generate a number of disjoint subgraphs, each representing a detected text instance. As GCN can effectively leverage context information to improve link prediction accuracy, our GCN based text-line grouping approach can achieve better text detection accuracy than previous text-line grouping methods, especially when dealing with text instances with large inter-character or very small inter-line spacings. Consequently, the proposed ReLaText achieves state-of-the-art performance on five public text detection benchmarks, namely RCTW-17, MSRA-TD500, Total-Text, CTW1500 and DAST1500.

"  Driven by growing momentum in two-dimensional geophysical flow modeling, this paper introduces a general family of ""thermal"" rotating shallow-water models. The models are capable of accommodating thermodynamic processes, such as those acting in the ocean mixed layer, by allowing buoyancy to vary in horizontal position and time as well as with depth, in a polynomial fashion up to an arbitrary degree. Moreover, the models admit Euler--Poincare variational formulations and possess Lie--Poisson Hamiltonian structure. Such a geometric property provides solid fundamental support to the theories described with consequences for numerical implementation and the construction of unresolved motion parametrizations. In particular, it is found that stratification halts the development of small-scale filament rollups recently observed in a popular model, which, having vertically homogeneous density, represents a special case of the models presented here.

"  As a first step toward realizing a dynamical system that evolves while spontaneously determining its own rule for time evolution, function dynamics (FD) is analyzed. FD consists of a functional equation with a self-referential term, given as a dynamical system of a 1-dimensional map. Through the time evolution of this system, a dynamical graph (a network) emerges. This graph has three interesting properties: i) vertices appear as stable elements, ii) the terminals of directed edges change in time, and iii) some vertices determine the dynamics of edges, and edges determine the stability of the vertices, complementarily. Two aspects of FD are studied, the generation of a graph (network) structure and the dynamics of this graph (network) in the system. ",Dynamical Networks in Function Dynamics
"  We numerically explore the behavior of repelling and aligning self-propelled polar particles (boids) in 2D enclosed by a damped flexible and elastic loop-shaped boundary. We observe disordered, polar ordered (or jammed) and circulating states. The latter produce a rich variety of boundary shapes including; circles, ovals, irregulars, ruffles, or sprockets, depending upon the bending moment of the boundary and the boundary to particle mass ratio. With the exception of the circulating states with non-round boundaries, states resemble those exhibited by attracting self-propelled particles, but here the confining boundary acts in place of a cohesive force. We attribute the formation of ruffles to instability mediated by pressure on the boundary when the speed of waves on the boundary approximately matches the self-propelled particle's swim speed.

"  A unified framework to derive discrete time-marching schemes for coupling of immersed solid and elastic objects to the lattice Boltzmann method is presented. Based on operator splitting for the discrete Boltzmann equation, second-order time-accurate schemes for the immersed boundary method, viscous force coupling and external boundary force are derived. Furthermore, a modified formulation of the external boundary force is introduced that leads to a more accurate no-slip boundary condition. The derivation also reveals that the coupling methods can be cast into a unified form, and that the immersed boundary method can be interpreted as the limit of force coupling for vanishing particle mass. In practice, the ratio between fluid and particle mass determines the strength of the force transfer in the coupling. The integration schemes formally improve the accuracy of first-order algorithms that are commonly employed when coupling immersed objects to a lattice Boltzmann fluid. It is anticipated that they will also lead to superior long-time stability in simulations of complex fluids with multiple scales.

  We report the presence of a correlation between the bulk and interfacial properties of electrostatic coacervate complexes. Complexes were obtained by co-assembly between cationic-neutral diblocks and oppositely charged surfactant micelles or 7 nm cerium oxide nanoparticles. Light scattering and reflectometry measurements revealed that the hybrid nanoparticle aggregates were more stable both through dilution and rinsing (from either a polystyrene or a silica surfaces) than their surfactant counterparts.

We compute scaling relations between the BCG and cluster velocity dispersions and their corresponding masses (i.e. $M_\mathrm{BCG}^{\star}$- $\sigma_\mathrm{BCG}^{\star}$, $M_{200}$- $\sigma_{200}$, $M_\mathrm{BCG}^{\star}$- $M_{200}$, $\sigma_\mathrm{BCG}^{\star}$- $\sigma_{200}$), we find in general a good agreement with observational results. Our simulations also predict $\sigma_\mathrm{BCG}^{\star}$- $\sigma_{200}$ relation to not change significantly up to redshift $z=1$, in line with a relatively slow accretion of the BCG stellar mass at late times. We analyze the main features of the velocity dispersion profiles, as traced by stars, dark matter, and galaxies. As a result, we discuss that observed stellar velocity dispersion profiles in the inner cluster regions are in excellent agreement with simulations. We also report that the slopes of the BCG velocity dispersion profile from simulations agree with what is measured in observations, confirming the existence of a robust correlation between the stellar velocity dispersion slope and the cluster velocity dispersion (thus, cluster mass) when the former is computed within $0.1 R_{500}$. Our results demonstrate that simulations can correctly describe the dynamics of BCGs and their surrounding stellar envelope, as determined by the past star-formation and assembly histories of the most massive galaxies of the Universe.

"  This paper follows the recent history of automated beauty competitions to discuss how machine learning techniques, in particular neural networks, alter the way attractiveness is handled and how this impacts the cultural landscape. We describe experiments performed to probe the behavior of two different convolutional neural network architectures in the classification of facial attractiveness in a large database of celebrity faces. As opposed to other easily definable facial features, attractiveness is difficult to detect robustly even for the best classification systems. Based on the observations from these experiments, we discuss several approaches to detect factors that come into play when a machine evaluates human features, and how bias can occur not only in data selection but in network architectures; in multiple forms on multiple levels throughout the process. The overall goal is to map out with mixed methods a novel condition: slippages produced by platform level machine learning systems that make judgements in domains considered dependent on high level human intelligence.

"  In a recent paper (Phys. Rev. B {\bf 78}, 075316 (2008)), Sajeev and Moiseyev demonstrated that the bound-to-resonant transitions and lifetimes of autoionizing states in spherical quantum dots can be controlled by varying the confinment strength. In the present paper, we report that such control can in some cases be compromised by the presence of Coulomb impurities. It is demonstrated that a screened Coulomb impurity placed in the vicinity of the dot center can lead to bound-to-resonant transitions and to avoided crossings-like behavior when the screening of the impurity charge is varied. It is argued that these properties also can have impact on electron transport through quantum dot arrays.

"  A significant amount of data on the historical and current behaviour of variable stars is derived from visual estimates of brightness using a set of comparison stars. To make optimum use of this invaluable collection one must understand the characteristics of visual photometry, which are significantly different from those of electronic or photographic data. Here I show that the dispersion of estimates among observers is very consistent at between 0.2 and 0.3 magnitudes and, surprisingly, has no apparent dependence on the colour of comparison stars or on their spacing in brightness.

"  The mean and the scatter of the HI content of a dark-matter halo as a function of the halo mass are useful statistics that can be used to test models of structure and galaxy formation. We investigate the possibility of constraining this HI-halo mass relation (HIHMR) from intensity maps of the redshifted 21 cm line. In particular, we use the geometry and topology of the brightness-temperature isocontours in a single frequency channel as quantified by the Minkowski functionals. First, we generate mock maps from a large N-body simulation considering the impact of thermal noise and foreground removal. We then use the Fisher information formalism to forecast constraints on a parametric model for the HIHMR. We consider a 20,000 deg$^2$ survey (originally proposed for dark-energy science) conducted with the Square Kilometre Array Phase 1 (SKA-1) MID observatory operating in single-dish mode. For a channel bandwidth of 2 MHz, we show that an integration time of a few$\,\times\,10^4$ s per pointing is sufficient to image the smoothed HI distribution at redshift $z \simeq 1$ and to measure the HIHMR in a nearly optimal way from the Minkowski functionals. Tighter constraints on some of the parameters can be obtained by using also an independent measurement of the mean HI density. Combining the results from different frequency channels provides exquisite constraints on the evolution of the HIHMR, especially in the central frequency range of the data cube.

"  The recent, counter-intuitive discovery that deep generative models (DGMs) can frequently assign a higher likelihood to outliers has implications for both outlier detection applications as well as our overall understanding of generative modeling. In this work, we present a possible explanation for this phenomenon, starting from the observation that a model's typical set and high-density region may not conincide. From this vantage point we propose a novel outlier test, the empirical success of which suggests that the failure of existing likelihood-based outlier tests does not necessarily imply that the corresponding generative model is uncalibrated. We also conduct additional experiments to help disentangle the impact of low-level texture versus high-level semantics in differentiating outliers. In aggregate, these results suggest that modifications to the standard evaluation practices and benchmarks commonly applied in the literature are needed.

"  We analyze the dynamics of the molecular field incoherently pumped by the photoassociation of fermionic atoms and coupled by quantum tunnelling in a double-well potential. The relative phase distribution of the molecular modes in each well and their phase coherence are shown to build up owing to quantum mechanical fluctuations starting from the vacuum state. We identify three qualitatively different steady-state phase distributions, depending on the ratio of the molecule-molecule interaction strength to interwell tunnelling, and examine the crossover from a phase-coherent regime to a phase-incoherent regime as this ratio increases.

"  We present results from high-resolution infrared observations of magnetars SGR1806-20 and SGR 1900+14 over 5 years using laser-supported adaptive optics at the 10-m Keck Observatory. Our measurements of the proper motions of these magnetars provide robust links between magnetars and their progenitors and provide age estimates for magnetars. At the measured distances of their putative associations, we measure the linear transverse velocity of SGR 1806-20 to be 350 +/- 100 km/s and of SGR 1900+14 to be 130 +/- 30 km/s. The transverse velocity vectors for both magnetars point away from the clusters of massive stars, solidifying their proposed associations. Assuming that the magnetars were born in the clusters, we can estimate the braking index to be ~1.8 for SGR 1806-20 and ~1.2 for SGR 1900+14. This is significantly lower than the canonical value of n = 3 predicted by the magnetic dipole spin-down suggesting an alternative source of dissipation such as twisted magnetospheres or particle winds.

"  We establish a theorem computing the cohomology groups of line bundles on homogeneous ind-varieties $G/B$ for diagonal ind-groups $G$.

"  In this contribution we would like to revisit the problems of ferromagnetism (F) and antiferromagnetism (AF) in the pure itinerant model. These methods can be extended later to the superconducting materials. In our model we assume the extended Hubbard Hamiltonian. Transition from the paramagnetic state to the ordered state of magnetic nature is decided by the competition between kinetic and potential energy in which there is an increase in the kinetic energy moderated by the inter-site interactions, and a decrease in the potential energy. The competition between these two energies results in the existence of critical values of interactions for creating magnetic alignment. Only when existing in a given material interaction exceeds the critical value for a given type of ordering we can have the alignment of this type.   The influence of inter-site correlation on F and AF in the presence of Coulomb on-site correlation is investigated. The well known Landau free energy expansion is corrected for both F and AF ordering to reflect the presence of critical interaction in the second order term, which leads to the magnetic alignment.   The numerical results show that the inter-site interactions favor F at the end of the band and AF at the half-filled point. In both cases of F and AF ordering, these interactions lower substantially the Curie and Neel's temperature towards experimental data. This helps to remove the paradox in magnetism that has persisted for a long time. ",Correlation Effects in Itinerant Magnetism
"  We study the perturbative QCD series for the hadronic width of the Z boson. We sum a class of large ``pi^2 terms'' and reorganize the series so as to minimize ``renormalon'' effects. We also consider the renormalization scheme-scale ambiguity of the perturbative results. We find that, with three nontrivial known terms in the perturbative expansion, the treatment of the pi^2 terms is quite important, while renormalon effects are less important. The measured hadronic width of the Z is often used to determine the value of alpha_s(M_Z^2). A standard method is to use the perturbative expansion for the width truncated at order alpha_s^3 in the MS-bar scheme with scale mu = M_Z. We estimate that the determined value of alpha_s(M_Z^2) should be increased by 0.6% compared to the value extracted with this standard method. After this adjustment for pi^2 and renormalon effects, we estimate that the uncertainty in alpha_s(M_Z^2) arising from QCD theory is about 0.4%. This is, of course, much less than the experimental uncertainty of about 5%. ",On the QCD perturbative expansion for e^+ e^- --> hadrons
"  This document proposes a collection of simplified models relevant to the design of new-physics searches at the LHC and the characterization of their results. Both ATLAS and CMS have already presented some results in terms of simplified models, and we encourage them to continue and expand this effort, which supplements both signature-based results and benchmark model interpretations. A simplified model is defined by an effective Lagrangian describing the interactions of a small number of new particles. Simplified models can equally well be described by a small number of masses and cross-sections. These parameters are directly related to collider physics observables, making simplified models a particularly effective framework for evaluating searches and a useful starting point for characterizing positive signals of new physics. This document serves as an official summary of the results from the ""Topologies for Early LHC Searches"" workshop, held at SLAC in September of 2010, the purpose of which was to develop a set of representative models that can be used to cover all relevant phase space in experimental searches. Particular emphasis is placed on searches relevant for the first ~50-500 pb-1 of data and those motivated by supersymmetric models. This note largely summarizes material posted at http://lhcnewphysics.org/, which includes simplified model definitions, Monte Carlo material, and supporting contacts within the theory community. We also comment on future developments that may be useful as more data is gathered and analyzed by the experiments. ",Simplified Models for LHC New Physics Searches
"  A new approach is presented to improve the performance of semiempirical quantum mechanical (SQM) methods in the description of noncovalent interactions. To show the strategy, the PM6 Hamiltonian was selected, although, in general, the procedure can be applied to other semiempirical Hamiltonians and to different methodologies. In this way, analytical corrections to PM6 were derived from fits to CCSD(T) - PM6 interaction energy differences. A set of small molecules was selected as representative of the common functional groups, and intermolecular potential energy curves were evaluated for the most relevant orientations of interacting molecular pairs. The resulting method, called PM6-FGC (from Functional Group Corrections), significantly improves the performance of PM6 and previous corrected SQM methods, and shows the importance of including a sufficient number of orientations of the interacting molecules in the reference data set in order to obtain well-balanced descriptions.

"  In a previous paper (Ouyed et al. 2004) we presented a new model for soft gamma-ray repeaters (SGR), based on the onset of colour superconductivity in quark stars. In this model, the bursts result from the reorganization of the exterior magnetic field following the formation of vortices that confine the internal magnetic field (the \mz effect). Here we extend the model by presenting full 3-dimensional simulations of the evolution of the inclined exterior magnetic field immediately following vortex formation. The simulations capture the violent reconnection events in the entangled surface magnetic field as it evolves into a smooth, more stable, configuration which consists of a dipole field aligned with the star's rotation axis. The total magnetic energy dissipated in this process is found to be of the order of $10^{44} \mathrm{erg}$ and, if it is emitted as synchrotron radiation, peaks typically at $280 \mathrm{keV}$. The intensity decays temporally in a way resembling SGRs and AXPs (anomalous X-ray pulsars), with a tail lasting from a few to a few hundred times the rotation period of the star, depending on the initial inclination between the rotation and dipole axis. One of the obvious consequences of our model's final state (aligned rotator) is the suppression of radio-emission in SGRs and AXPs following their bursting era. We suggest that magnetar-like magnetic field strength alone cannot be responsible for the properties of SGRs and AXPs, while a quark star entering the ``Meissner phase'' is compatible with the observational facts. We compare our model to observations and highlight our predictions. ",3-Dimensional Simulations of the Reorganization of a Quark Star's   Magnetic Field as Induced by the Meissner Effect
"  The fitness landscape metaphor plays a central role on the modeling of optimizing principles in many research fields, ranging from evolutionary biology, where it was first introduced, to management research. Here we consider the ensemble of trajectories of the imitative learning search, in which agents exchange information on their fitness and imitate the fittest agent in the population aiming at reaching the global maximum of the fitness landscape. We assess the degree to which the starting and ending points determine the learning trajectories using two measures, namely, the predictability that yields the probability that two randomly chosen trajectories are the same, and the mean path divergence that gauges the dissimilarity between two learning trajectories. We find that the predictability is greater in rugged landscapes than in smooth ones. The mean path divergence, however, is strongly affected by the search parameters -- population size and imitation propensity -- that obliterate the influence of the underlying landscape. The learning trajectories become more deterministic, in the sense that there are fewer distinct trajectories and those trajectories are more similar to each other, with increasing population size and imitation propensity. In addition, we find that the roughness of the learning trajectories, which measures the deviation from additivity of the fitness function, is always greater than the roughness estimated over the entire fitness landscape. ",Predictability of the imitative learning trajectories
"  We verify the infinitesimal inversive rigidity of almost all triangulated circle polyhedra in the Euclidean plane $\mathbb{E}^{2}$, as well as the infinitesimal inversive rigidity of tangency circle packings on the $2$-sphere $\mathbb{S}^{2}$. From this the rigidity of almost all triangulated circle polyhedra follows. The proof adapts Gluck's proof in~\cite{gluck75} of the rigidity of almost all Euclidean polyhedra to the setting of circle polyhedra, where inversive distances replace Euclidean distances and M\""obius transformations replace rigid Euclidean motions.

"  Recently, several interesting proposals were made modifying the law of gravity on large scales, within a sensible relativistic formulation. This allows a precise formulation of the idea that such a modification might account for galaxy rotation curves, instead of the usual interpretation of these curves as evidence for dark matter. We here summarize several observational constraints which any such modification must satisfy, and which we believe make more challenging any interpretation of galaxy rotation curves in terms of new gravitational physics.

"  We present ultraviolet (UV) observations of six nearby Type~Ia supernovae (SNe~Ia) obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope, three of which were also observed in the near-IR (NIR) with Wide-Field Camera~3. UV observations with the Swift satellite, as well as ground-based optical and near-infrared data provide complementary information. The combined data-set covers the wavelength range $0.2$--$2~\mu$m. By also including archival data of SN 2014J, we analyse a sample spanning observed colour excesses up to $E(B-V)=1.4~$mag. We study the wavelength dependent extinction of each individual SN and find a diversity of reddening laws when characterised by the total-to-selective extinction $R_V$. In particular, we note that for the two SNe with $E(B-V)\gtrsim1~$mag, for which the colour excess is dominated by dust extinction, we find $R_V=1.4\pm0.1$ and $R_V=2.8\pm0.1$. Adding UV photometry reduces the uncertainty of fitted $R_V$ by $\sim50\,$% allowing us to also measure $R_V$ of individual low-extinction objects which point to a similar diversity, currently not accounted for in the analyses when SNe~Ia are used for studying the expansion history of the universe.

"  Dexterous manipulation has been a long-standing challenge in robotics. Recently, modern model-free RL has demonstrated impressive results on a number of problems. However, complex domains like dexterous manipulation remain a challenge for RL due to the poor sample complexity. To address this, current approaches employ expert demonstrations in the form of state-action pairs, which are difficult to obtain for real-world settings such as learning from videos. In this work, we move toward a more realistic setting and explore state-only imitation learning. To tackle this setting, we train an inverse dynamics model and use it to predict actions for state-only demonstrations. The inverse dynamics model and the policy are trained jointly. Our method performs on par with state-action approaches and considerably outperforms RL alone. By not relying on expert actions, we are able to learn from demonstrations with different dynamics, morphologies, and objects. ",State-Only Imitation Learning for Dexterous Manipulation
"  Very recently, molecular rotational transitions observed in the photon-dominated region of the Horsehead nebula have been attributed to l-C3H+. In an effort to corroborate this finding, we employed state-of-the art and proven high-accuracy quantum chemical techniques to compute spectroscopic constants for this cation and its isotopologues. Even though the B rotational constant from the fit of the observed spectrum and our computations agree to within 20 MHz, a typical level of accuracy, the D rotational constant differs by more than 40%, while the H rotational constant differs by three orders of magnitude. With the likely errors in the rotational transition energies resulting from this difference in D on the order of 1 MHz for the lowest observed transition (J = 4 <- 3) and growing as J increases, the assignment of the observed rotational lines from the Horsehead nebula to l-C3H+ is questionable.

"  Optimal experiment design for parameter estimation is a research topic that has been in the interest of various studies. A key problem in optimal input design is that the optimal input depends on some unknown system parameters that are to be identified. Adaptive design is one of the fundamental routes to handle this problem. Although there exist a rich collection of results on adaptive experiment design, there are few results that address these issues for dynamic systems.

"  To better understand the effectiveness of continued training, we analyze the major components of a neural machine translation system (the encoder, decoder, and each embedding space) and consider each component's contribution to, and capacity for, domain adaptation. We find that freezing any single component during continued training has minimal impact on performance, and that performance is surprisingly good when a single component is adapted while holding the rest of the model fixed. We also find that continued training does not move the model very far from the out-of-domain model, compared to a sensitivity analysis metric, suggesting that the out-of-domain model can provide a good generic initialization for the new domain.

"  Under certain mild conditions, some limit theorems for functionals of two independent Gaussian processes are obtained. The results apply to general Gaussian processes including fractional Brownian motion, sub-fractional Brownian motion and bi-fractional Brownian motion. A new and interesting phenomenon is that, in comparison with the results for fractional Brownian motion, extra randomness appears in the limiting distributions for Gaussian processes with nonstationary increments, say sub-fractional Brownian motion and bi-fractional Brownian. The results are obtained based on the method of moments, in which Fourier analysis, the chaining argument introduced in \cite{nx1} and a paring technique are employed.

"  A detailed investigation was carried out to understand a prolonged (~44 hours) weakly southward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF-Bz) condition during May 02--04, 1998. In-situ observations, during the period, showed the passage of an expanding magnetic cloud embedded in an interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME), followed up by a shock and an interplanetary discontinuity driven by another ICME. It is the arrival of the ICMEs and the upfront shocks that cause the prolonged southward IMF-Bz condition. The magnetic configuration of the source regions of the IMF associated with the ICME interval were also examined, which showed open magnetic field structures, emanating from a small active region on the north of the heliospheric current sheet (HCS). The structures remained constantly to the north of the HCS, both on April 29 and May 01, suggesting no change in their polarity. The draping of these outward directed radial field lines around the propagating CMEs in the shocked plasma explained the observed polarity changes of the IMF-Bz at 1 AU. In addition, multiple enhancements were also detected in the geomagnetic field variations, which showed a distinct one-to-one correspondence with the density pulses observed at 1 AU, during 0700--1700 UT on May 03. The spectral analysis of both the variations showed the same discrete frequencies of 0.48, 0.65 and 0.75 mHz, demonstrating that the solar wind density enhancements can cause detectable global geomagnetic disturbances. The observations, thus, provide a deeper insight into the possible causes and geomagnetic consequences of a prolonged weakly southward IMF-Bz condition.

"  The design of a mechanical transmission taking into account the transmitted forces is reported in this paper. This transmission is based on Slide-o-Cam, a cam mechanism with multiple rollers mounted on a common translating follower. The design of Slide-o-Cam, a transmission intended to produce a sliding motion from a turning drive, or vice versa, was reported elsewhere. This transmission provides pure-rolling motion, thereby reducing the friction of rack-and-pinions and linear drives. The pressure angle is a suitable performance index for this transmission because it determines the amount of force transmitted to the load vs. that transmitted to the machine frame. To assess the transmission capability of the mechanism, the Hertz formula is introduced to calculate the stresses on the rollers and on the cams.

"  We study the velocity distribution of Milky Way disk stars in a kiloparsec-sized region around the Sun, based on ~ 2 million M-type stars from DR7 of SDSS, which have newly re-calibrated absolute proper motions from combining SDSS positions with the USNO-B catalogue. We estimate photometric distances to all stars, accurate to ~ 20 %, and combine them with the proper motions to derive tangential velocities for this kinematically unbiased sample of stars. Based on a statistical de-projection method we then derive the vertical profiles (to heights of Z = 800 pc above the disk plane) for the first and second moments of the three dimensional stellar velocity distribution. We find that <W> = -7 +/- 1 km/s and <U> = -9 +/- 1 km/s, independent of height above the mid-plane, reflecting the Sun's motion with respect to the local standard of rest. In contrast, <V> changes distinctly from -20 +/- 2 km/s in the mid-plane to <V> = -32 km/s at Z = 800 pc, reflecting an asymmetric drift of the stellar mean velocity that increases with height. All three components of the M-star velocity dispersion show a strong linear rise away from the mid-plane, most notably \sigma_{ZZ}, which grows from 18 km/s (Z = 0) to 40 km/s (at Z = 800 pc). We determine the orientation of the velocity ellipsoid, and find a significant vertex deviation of 20 to 25 degrees, which decreases only slightly to heights of Z = 800 pc. Away from the mid-plane, our sample exhibits a remarkably large tilt of the velocity ellipsoid towards the Galactic plane, which reaches 20 deg. at Z = 800 pc and which is not easily explained. Finally, we determine the ratio \sigma^2_{\phi\phi}/\sigma^2_{RR} near the mid-plane, which in the epicyclic approximation implies an almost perfectly flat rotation curve at the Solar radius.

"  We present K'(2.1 micron) observations of four nearby flocculent spirals, which clearly show low-level spiral structure and suggest that kiloparsec-scale spiral structure is more prevalent in flocculent spirals than previously supposed. In particular, the prototypical flocculent spiral NGC 5055 is shown to have regular, two-arm spiral structure to a radius of 4 kpc in the near infrared, with an arm-interarm contrast of 1.3. The spiral structure in all four galaxies is weaker than that in grand design galaxies. Taken in unbarred galaxies with no large, nearby companions, these data are consistent with the modal theory of spiral density waves, which maintains that density waves are intrinsic to the disk. As an alternative, mechanisms for driving spiral structure with non-axisymmetric perturbers are also discussed. These observations highlight the importance of near infrared imaging for exploring the range of physical environments in which large-scale dynamical processes, such as density waves, are important.

"  The Kaczmarz algorithm is popular for iteratively solving an overdetermined system of linear equations. The traditional Kaczmarz algorithm can approximate the solution in few sweeps through the equations but a randomized version of the Kaczmarz algorithm was shown to converge exponentially and independent of number of equations. Recently an algorithm for finding sparse solution to a linear system of equations has been proposed based on weighted randomized Kaczmarz algorithm. These algorithms solves single measurement vector problem; however there are applications were multiple-measurements are available. In this work, the objective is to solve a multiple measurement vector problem with common sparse support by modifying the randomized Kaczmarz algorithm. We have also modeled the problem of face recognition from video as the multiple measurement vector problem and solved using our proposed technique. We have compared the proposed algorithm with state-of-art spectral projected gradient algorithm for multiple measurement vectors on both real and synthetic datasets. The Monte Carlo simulations confirms that our proposed algorithm have better recovery and convergence rate than the MMV version of spectral projected gradient algorithm under fairness constraints.

"  The observational effect of all minimally coupled scalar field models of dark energy can be determined by the behavior of the following two parameters : (1) equation of state parameter $w$, which relates dark energy pressure to its energy density, and (2) effective speed of sound $c_{e}^{2}$, which relates dark energy pressure fluctuation to its density fluctuation. In this paper we show that these two parameters do not uniquely determine the form of a scalar field dark energy Lagrangian even after taking into account the perturbation in the scalar field. We present this result by showing that two different forms of scalar field Lagrangian can lead to the same values for these paired parameters. It is well known that from the background evolution the Lagrangian of the scalar field dark energy cannot be uniquely determined. The two models of dark energy presented in this paper are indistinguishable from the evolution of background as well as from the evolution of perturbations from a FRW metric.

"  Most differentiable neural architecture search methods construct a super-net for search and derive a target-net as its sub-graph for evaluation. There exists a significant gap between the architectures in search and evaluation. As a result, current methods suffer from an inconsistent, inefficient, and inflexible search process. In this paper, we introduce EnTranNAS that is composed of Engine-cells and Transit-cells. The Engine-cell is differentiable for architecture search, while the Transit-cell only transits a sub-graph by architecture derivation. Consequently, the gap between the architectures in search and evaluation is significantly reduced. Our method also spares much memory and computation cost, which speeds up the search process. A feature sharing strategy is introduced for more balanced optimization and more efficient search. Furthermore, we develop an architecture derivation method to replace the traditional one that is based on a hand-crafted rule. Our method enables differentiable sparsification, and keeps the derived architecture equivalent to that of Engine-cell, which further improves the consistency between search and evaluation. Besides, it supports the search for topology where a node can be connected to prior nodes with any number of connections, so that the searched architectures could be more flexible. For experiments on CIFAR-10, our search on the standard space requires only 0.06 GPU-day. We further have an error rate of 2.22% with 0.07 GPU-day for the search on an extended space. We can also directly perform the search on ImageNet with topology learnable and achieve a top-1 error rate of 23.8% in 2.1 GPU-day.

"  A search for new long-lived particles decaying to leptons is presented using proton-proton collisions produced by the LHC at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV. Data used for the analysis were collected by the CMS detector and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 inverse femtobarns. Events are selected with an electron and a muon that have transverse impact parameter values between 0.02 cm and 2 cm. The search has been designed to be sensitive to a wide range of models with nonprompt e-mu final states. Limits are set on the ""displaced supersymmetry"" model, with pair production of top squarks decaying into an e-mu final state via R-parity-violating interactions. The results are the most restrictive to date on this model, with the most stringent limit being obtained for a top squark lifetime corresponding to c tau = 2 cm, excluding masses below 790 GeV at 95% confidence level.

  In this article we provide explicit computations of the quantum corrections to the lightest CP-even Higgs Boson mass in the real version of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. We compute the contributions coming from the SUSY-QCD sector with a precision of three loops at order $O(\alpha_t\alpha_s^2)$. The renormalization procedure adopted is based on the dimensional reduction scheme in order to preserve supersymmetry to all perturbative orders. The calculation extends the region of validity of previous studies to the whole supersymmetric parameter space. The involved master integrals have been computed by exploiting new proposed approaches based on the dispersion relation techniques for the numerical calculation of three-loop vacuum integrals with arbitrary mass scales. ,The Lightest Higgs Boson Mass of the MSSM at Three-Loop Accuracy
"  Magnetic frustration in metals is scarce and hard to pinpoint, but exciting due to the possibility of the emergence of fascinating novel phases. The cubic intermetallic compound HoInCu$_4$ with all holmium atoms on an fcc lattice, exhibits partial magnetic frustration, yielding a ground state where half of the Ho moments remain without long-range order, as evidenced by our neutron scattering experiments. The substitution of In with Cd results in HoCdCu$_4$ in a full breakdown of magnetic frustration. Consequently we found a fully ordered magnetic structure in our neutron diffraction experiments. These findings are in agreement with the local energy scales and crystal electric field excitations, which we determined from specific heat and inelastic neutron scattering data. The electronic density of states for the itinerant bands acts as tuning parameter for the ratio between nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor interactions and thus for magnetic frustration.

"  We present an error correcting protocol that enhances the lifetime of stabilizer code based qubits which are susceptible to the creation of pairs of localized defects (due to string-like error operators) at finite temperature, such as the toric code. The primary tool employed is dynamic application of a local, unitary operator which exchanges defects and thereby translates localized excitations. Crucially, the protocol does not require any measurements of stabilizer operators, and therefore can be used to enhance the lifetime of a qubit in the absence of such experimental resources.

"  Based on a detailed analysis of the high-quality Chandra, XMM-Newton, and Suzaku data of the X-ray bright cluster of galaxies Abell 1795, we report clear evidence for a two-phase intracluster medium (ICM) structure, which consists of a cool (with a temperature T = 2.0-2.2 keV) and a hot (T = 5.0-5.7 keV) component that coexist and dominate the X-ray emission at least in the central 80 kpc. A third weak emission component (T = 0.8 keV) is also detected within the innermost 144 kpc and is ascribed to a portion of inter-stellar medium (ISM) of the cD galaxy. Deprojected spectral analysis reveals flat radial temperature distributions for both the hot phase and cool phase components. These results are consistent with the ASCA measurements reported in Xu et al. (1998), and resemble the previous findings for the Centaurus cluster (e.g., Takahashi et al. 2009). By analyzing the emission measure ratio and gas metal abundance maps created from the Chandra data, we find that the cool phase component is more metal-enriched than the hot phase one in 50-100 kpc region, which agrees with that found in M87 (Simionescu et al. 2008). The coexistence of the cool phase and hot phase ICM cannot be realized by bubble uplifting from active galactic nuclei (AGN) alone. Instead, the two-phase ICM properties are better reconciled with a cD corona model (Makishima et al. 2001).

"  We propose a texture template approach, consisting of a set of virtual minutiae, to improve the overall latent fingerprint recognition accuracy. To compensate for the lack of sufficient number of minutiae in poor quality latent prints, we generate a set of virtual minutiae. However, due to a large number of these regularly placed virtual minutiae, texture based template matching has a large computational requirement compared to matching true minutiae templates. To improve both the accuracy and efficiency of the texture template matching, we investigate: i) both original and enhanced fingerprint patches for training convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) to improve the distinctiveness of descriptors associated with each virtual minutiae, ii) smaller patches around virtual minutiae and a fast ConvNet architecture to speed up descriptor extraction, iii) reduce the descriptor length, iv) a modified hierarchical graph matching strategy to improve the matching speed, and v) extraction of multiple texture templates to boost the performance. Experiments on NIST SD27 latent database show that the above strategies can improve the matching speed from 11 ms (24 threads) per comparison (between a latent and a reference print) to only 7.7 ms (single thread) per comparison while improving the rank-1 accuracy by 8.9% against 10K gallery.

"  Structures observed in debris disks may be caused by gravitational interaction with planetary or stellar companions. These perturbed disks are often thought to indicate the presence of planets and offer insights into the properties of both the disk and the perturbing planets. Gaps in debris disks may indicate a planet physically present within the gap, but such gaps can also occur away from the planet's orbit at mean-motion resonances (MMRs), and this is the focus of our interest here. We extend our study of planet-disk interaction through MMRs, presented in an earlier paper, to systems in which the perturbing planet has moderate orbital eccentricity, a common occurrence in exoplanetary systems. In particular, a new result is that the 3:1 MMR becomes distinct at higher eccentricity, while its effects are absent for circular planetary orbits. We also only consider gravitational interaction with a planetary body of at least 1 Jupiter mass. Our earlier work shows that even a 1 Earth mass planet can theoretically open an MMR gap; however, given the narrow gap that can be opened by a low-mass planet, its observability would be questionable. We find that the widths, locations, and shapes of two prominent structures, the 2:1 and 3:1 MMRs, could be used to determine the mass, semimajor axis, and eccentricity of the planetary perturber and present an algorithm for doing so. These MMR structures can be used to narrow the position and even determine the planetary properties (such as mass) of any inferred but as-yet-unseen planets within a debris disk. We also briefly discuss the implications of eccentric disks on brightness asymmetries and their dependence on the wavelengths with which these disks are observed.

"  In this paper we study how to include the cosmological constant in geometric scalar theory of gravity (GSG). Firstly we show that the cosmological constant could not be modeled by a matter field, unlike in General Relativity. We also show that a spherically symmetric matter distribution, over the de Sitter vacuum, does not produce the Kottler solution and no black hole. To circumvent this problem we introduce an coupling term between the scalar field and the vacuum curvature in way to provide the Kottler solution. We also apply the original (GSGI) and the modified (GSGII) geometric scalar theory of gravity to the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmology. A numerical analysis indicates that GSGII is most sensible to the cosmological constant them GSGI. ",About the cosmological constant in geometric scalar theory of gravity
"  Recently, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) has been used to highlight an anomalously large band renormalization at high binding energies in cuprate superconductors: the high energy 'waterfall' or high energy anomaly (HEA). This paper demonstrates, using a combination of new ARPES measurements and quantum Monte Carlo simulations, that the HEA is not simply the by-product of matrix element effects, but rather represents a cross-over from a quasiparticle band at low binding energies near the Fermi level to valence bands at higher binding energy, assumed to be of strong oxygen character, in both hole- and electron-doped cuprates. While photoemission matrix elements clearly play a role in changing the aesthetic appearance of the band dispersion, i.e. the 'waterfall'-like behavior, they provide an inadequate description for the physics that underlies the strong band renormalization giving rise to the HEA. Model calculations of the single-band Hubbard Hamiltonian showcase the role played by correlations in the formation of the HEA and uncover significant differences in the HEA energy scale for hole- and electron-doped cuprates. In addition, this approach properly captures the transfer of spectral weight accompanying both hole and electron doping in a correlated material and provides a unifying description of the HEA across both sides of the cuprate phase diagram.

"  Entity linking involves aligning textual mentions of named entities to their corresponding entries in a knowledge base. Entity linking systems often exploit relations between textual mentions in a document (e.g., coreference) to decide if the linking decisions are compatible. Unlike previous approaches, which relied on supervised systems or heuristics to predict these relations, we treat relations as latent variables in our neural entity-linking model. We induce the relations without any supervision while optimizing the entity-linking system in an end-to-end fashion. Our multi-relational model achieves the best reported scores on the standard benchmark (AIDA-CoNLL) and substantially outperforms its relation-agnostic version. Its training also converges much faster, suggesting that the injected structural bias helps to explain regularities in the training data.

"  For any positive integer $k$, there exist neural networks with $\Theta(k^3)$ layers, $\Theta(1)$ nodes per layer, and $\Theta(1)$ distinct parameters which can not be approximated by networks with $\mathcal{O}(k)$ layers unless they are exponentially large --- they must possess $\Omega(2^k)$ nodes. This result is proved here for a class of nodes termed ""semi-algebraic gates"" which includes the common choices of ReLU, maximum, indicator, and piecewise polynomial functions, therefore establishing benefits of depth against not just standard networks with ReLU gates, but also convolutional networks with ReLU and maximization gates, sum-product networks, and boosted decision trees (in this last case with a stronger separation: $\Omega(2^{k^3})$ total tree nodes are required).

"  We analyze new optical spectra of a sample of 502 galaxies in close pairs and n-tuples, separated by <= 50/h kpc. We extracted the sample objectively from the CfA2 redshift survey, without regard to the surroundings of the tight systems. We probe the relationship between star formation and the dynamics of the systems of galaxies. The equivalent widths of H\alpha (EW(H\alpha) and other emission lines anti-correlate strongly with pair spatial separation (\Delta D) and velocity separation. We use the measured EW(H\alpha) and the starburst models of Leitherer et al. to estimate the time since the most recent burst of star for- mation began for each galaxy. In the absence of a large contribution from an old stellar population to the continuum around H\alpha, the observed \Delta D -- EW(H\alpha) correlation signifies that starbursts with larger separations on the sky are, on average, older. By matching the dynamical timescale to the burst timescale, we show that the data support a simple picture in which a close pass initiates a starburst; EW(H\alpha) decreases with time as the pair separation increases, accounting for the anti-correlation. This picture leads to a method for measuring the duration and the initial mass function of interaction-induced starbursts: our data are compatible with the starburst and orbit models in many respects, as long as the starburst lasts longer than \sim10^8 years and the delay between the close pass and the initiation of the starburst is less than a few \times 10^7 years. If there is no large contribution from an old stellar population to the continuum around H\alpha the Miller-Scalo and cutoff (M <= 30 M_\sun) Salpeter initial mass functions fit the data much better than a standard Salpeter IMF.

"  The shell-model-like approach is implemented to treat the cranking many-body Hamiltonian based on the covariant density functional theory including pairing correlations with exact particle number conservation. The self-consistency is achieved by iterating the single-particle occupation probabilities back to the densities and currents. As an example, the rotational structures observed in the neutron-rich nucleus $^{60}$Fe are investigated and analyzed. Without introducing any \emph{ad hoc} parameters, the bandheads, the rotational spectra, and the relations between the angular momentum and rotational frequency for the positive parity band A, and negative parity bands B and C are well reproduced. The essential role of the pairing correlations is revealed. It is found that for band A, the bandcrossing is due to the change of the last two occupied neutrons from the $1f_{5/2}$ signature partners to the $1g_{9/2}$ signature partners. For the two negative parity signature partner bands B and C, the bandcrossings are due to the pseudo-crossing between the $1f_{7/2,~5/2}$ and the $1f_{5/2,~1/2}$ orbitals. Generally speaking, the deformation parameters $\beta$ for bands A, B, and C decrease with rotational frequency. For band A, the deformation jumps from $\beta\sim0.19$ to $\beta\sim0.29$ around the bandcrossing. In comparison with its signature partner band C, band B exhibits appreciable triaxial deformation.

"  Resistive switching is one of the foremost candidates for building novel types of non-volatile random access memories. Any practical implementation of such a memory cell calls for a strong miniaturization, at which point fluctuations start playing a role that cannot be neglected. A detailed understanding of switching mechanisms and reliability is essential. For this reason, we formulate a particle model based on the stochastic motion of oxygen vacancies. It allows us to investigate fluctuations in the resistance states of a switch with two active zones. The vacancies' dynamics is governed by a master equation. Upon the application of a voltage pulse, the vacancies travel collectively through the switch. By deriving a generalized Burgers equation we can interpret this collective motion as nonlinear traveling waves, and numerically verify this result. Further, we define binary logical states by means of the underlying vacancy distributions, and establish a framework of writing and reading such memory element with voltage pulses. Considerations about the dis- criminability of these operations under fluctuations together with the markedness of the resistive switching effect itself lead to the conclusion, that an intermediate vacancy number is optimal for performance.

"  We introduce a numerical method based on an integral equation formulation for simulating drops in viscous fluids in the plane. It builds upon the method introduced by Kropinski in 2001, but improves on it by adding an interpolatory quadrature approach for handling near-singular integrals. Such integrals typically arise when drop boundaries come close to one another, and are difficult to compute accurately using standard quadrature rules. Adapting the interpolatory quadrature method introduced by Helsing and Ojala in 2008 to the current application, very general drop configurations can be handled while still maintaining stability and high accuracy. The performance of the new method is demonstrated by some challenging numerical examples. ",An accurate integral equation method for simulating multi-phase Stokes   flow
"  The subtle interplay of randomness and quantum fluctuations at low temperatures gives rise to a plethora of unconventional phenomena in systems ranging from quantum magnets and correlated electron materials to ultracold atomic gases. Particularly strong disorder effects have been predicted to occur at zero-temperature quantum phase transitions. Here, we demonstrate that the composition-driven ferromagnetic-to-paramagnetic quantum phase transition in Sr1-xCaxRuO3 is completely destroyed by the disorder introduced via the different ionic radii of the randomly distributed Sr and Ca ions. Using a magneto-optical technique, we map the magnetic phase diagram in the composition-temperature space. We find that the ferromagnetic phase is significantly extended by the disorder and develops a pronounced tail over a broad range of the composition x. These findings are explained by a microscopic model of smeared quantum phase transitions in itinerant magnets. Moreover, our theoretical study implies that correlated disorder is even more powerful in promoting ferromagnetism than random disorder.

  The nonlinear dynamics of the free surface of an ideal conducting liquid in a strong external electric field is studied.

"  Photonic methods of radio-frequency waveform generation and processing provide performance and flexibility over electronic methods due to the ultrawide bandwidth offered by the optical carriers.

"  Narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies are active galactic nuclei (AGN) believed to be in the early stages of their evolution. A fraction of them have been found to host relativistic jets. Due to the lack of large-scale diffuse radio emission they are believed to be experiencing one of their first activity cycles, and can offer us an opportunity to study the early evolution of more powerful AGN, such as radio galaxies and flat-spectrum radio quasars. Recently, a group of intriguing jetted NLS1s was discovered: based on high radio frequency data they host relativistic jets, but in the JVLA observations they all showed steep radio spectra at least up to 9.0~GHz, indicating very strong absorption at these frequencies. In this paper we study a subset of these sources in detail by employing spatially resolved radio spectral index maps at central frequencies of 1.6, 5.2, and 9.0~GHz. With spectral index maps we can disentangle the different radio emission components over the radio-emitting region, and get insights into the production mechanisms of radio emission. In addition, we study their host galaxies in relation to the radio emission to investigate if the host can provide us additional information regarding the origin of the radio emission, or the launching mechanism of the jets. It is fascinating how different the sources studied are, and certainly more, especially wide frequency-range, and high-resolution observations will be needed to understand their history and current properties, such as the reason behind the extraordinary radio spectra.

"  An assessment is made of the J-integral test procedure for initial crack growth in an open-cell aluminium alloy foam by combining finite element (FE) simulations with experiment. It is found experimentally that a zone of randomly failed struts develops ahead of the primary crack tip, and is comparable in size to that of the plastic zone. Hence, a crack tip J-field is absent at the initiation of crack growth from the primary crack tip. This implies that the measured J_IC value and the J versus crack extension Da curve cannot be treated as material properties despite the fact that the specimen size meets the usual criteria for J validity. The toughness tests were performed on a single-edge notched bend specimen, and crack extension was measured by the direct current potential drop method, by digital image correlation and by X-ray computed tomography. The crack growth resistance of the foam is associated with two distinct zones of plastic dissipation: (i) a bulk plastic zone emanating from the crack tip (containing a cluster of randomly failed struts), and (ii) a crack bridging zone behind the advancing crack tip. The applicability of a cohesive zone model to predict the fracture response is explored for the observed case of large scale bridging. To do so, FE simulations are performed by replacing the discrete lattice of the open-cell metallic foam by a compressible, elastic-plastic hardening solid while the fracture process zone in the foam is represented by a cohesive zone, as characterised by a tensile traction versus separation law. A detailed comparison of the cohesive zone model with experimental observations reveals that it is possible to capture the load versus displacement response but not the details of the fracture process zone using a single set of process zone parameters.

"  Food webs, networks of feeding relationships among organisms, provide fundamental insights into mechanisms that determine ecosystem stability and persistence. Despite long-standing interest in the compartmental structure of food webs, past network analyses of food webs have been constrained by a standard definition of compartments, or modules, that requires many links within compartments and few links between them. Empirical analyses have been further limited by low-resolution data for primary producers. In this paper, we present a Bayesian computational method for identifying group structure in food webs using a flexible definition of a group that can describe both functional roles and standard compartments. The Serengeti ecosystem provides an opportunity to examine structure in a newly compiled food web that includes species-level resolution among plants, allowing us to address whether groups in the food web correspond to tightly-connected compartments or functional groups, and whether network structure reflects spatial or trophic organization, or a combination of the two. We have compiled the major mammalian and plant components of the Serengeti food web from published literature, and we infer its group structure using our method. We find that network structure corresponds to spatially distinct plant groups coupled at higher trophic levels by groups of herbivores, which are in turn coupled by carnivore groups. Thus the group structure of the Serengeti web represents a mixture of trophic guild structure and spatial patterns, in contrast to the standard compartments typically identified in ecological networks. From data consisting only of nodes and links, the group structure that emerges supports recent ideas on spatial coupling and energy channels in ecosystems that have been proposed as important for persistence.

"  We consider algorithms and lower bounds for various problems over forest languages; as input models we allow forest algebras, deterministic forest automata and nondeterministic forest automata. For the equivalence problem, we give an almost-linear-time algorithm for both forest algebras and deterministic forest automata; this is complemented by a polynomial time hardness result. The emptiness problem is complete for polynomial time over each of the three models. Additionally, we consider the emptiness of intersection problem for forest algebras and deterministic forest automata; this problem turns out to be complete for exponential time. It is well-known that the corresponding problems for word languages are complete for nondeterministic logarithmic space and for polynomial space, respectively.   Equipped with this toolbox of algorithms and lower bounds, we consider various inclusion problems for regular forest languages under substitutions. The substitutions in this paper replace leaf variables by forest languages. Depending on the direction of the inclusion, the problem for a given substitution is either complete for polynomial time or for exponential time; in particular, the equivalence problem under substitutions is complete for exponential time and, hence, more difficult than the equivalence problem for forest languages without substitutions. If we ask whether there exists a substitution such that a given inclusion holds, then this problem is either complete for NP or exponential time, depending on whether we consider inclusion or equivalence; moreover, the problem is undecidable if the substitution is applied on both sides.

"  We study the kinetics of the nematic-isotropic transition in a two-dimensional liquid crystal by using a lattice Boltzmann scheme that couples the tensor order parameter and the flow consistently. Unlike in previous studies, we find the time dependences of the correlation function, energy density, and the number of topological defects obey dynamic scaling laws with growth exponents that, within the numerical uncertainties, agree with the value 1/2 expected from simple dimensional analysis. We find that these values are not altered by the hydrodynamic flow. In addition, by examining shallow quenches, we find that the presence of orientational disorder can inhibit amplitude ordering.

Weak violation of the time translational invariance in the quasi-equilibrium regime is analyzed in terms of effective stiffness for droplet excitations in the presence of domain walls. The simulated results in not only isothermal but also $T$-shift aging processes exhibit the expected scaling behavior with respect to the characteristic length scales associated with droplet excitations and domain walls in spite of the fact that the growth law for these length scales still shows a pre-asymptotic behavior compared with the asymptotic form proposed by the droplet theory.

"  We investigate the stability properties and the dynamics of Bose-Einstein condensates with axial symmetry, especially with dipolar long-range interaction, using both simulations on grids and variational calculations. We present an extended variational ansatz which is applicable for axial symmetry and show that this ansatz can reproduce the lowest eigenfrequencies of the Bogoliubov spectrum, and also the corresponding eigenfunctions. Our variational ansatz is capable of describing the roton instability of pancake-shaped dipolar condensates for arbitrary angular momenta. After investigating the linear regime we apply the ansatz to determine the dynamics and show how the angular collapse is correctly described within the variational framework.

"  The hybrid meson is one of the most interesting new hadron specie beyond the naive quark model. It acquire a great attention both from the theoretical and experimental efforts. Many good candidates have been claimed to be observed, but there is no absolute confirmation about existence of hybrid mesons. In the present work we propose new calculations of the masses and decay widths of the hybrid mesons in the context of constituent gluon model. ",Hybrid States from Constituent Glue Model
"  Rare earth elements recycling has been proposed to alleviate supply risks and market volatility. In this context, the potential of a new recycling pathway, namely plasma mass separation, is uncovered through the example of nedodymium - iron - boron magnets recycling. Plasma mass separation is shown to address some of the shortcomings of existing rare earth elements recycling pathways, in particular detrimental environmental effects. A simplified mass separation model suggests that plasma separation performances could compare favourably with existing recycling options. In addition, simple energetic considerations of plasma processing suggest that the cost of these techniques may not be prohibitive, particularly considering that energy costs from solar may become significantly cheaper. Further investigation and experimental demonstration of plasma separation techniques should permit asserting the potential of these techniques against other recycling techniques currently under development.

"  We consider a continuous-variable (CV) quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol over free-space channels, which is simpler and more robust than typical CV QKD protocols. It uses a bright laser, squeezed and modulated in the amplitude quadrature, and self-homodyne detection. We consider a scenario, where the line of sight is classically monitored to detect active eavesdroppers, so that we can assume a passive eavesdropper. Under this assumption, we analyse security of the QKD protocol in the composable finite-size regime. Proper modulation of the squeezed laser to the shot-noise level can completely eliminate information leakage to the eavesdropper and also eliminate the turbulence-induced noise of the channel in the amplitude quadrature. Under these conditions, estimation of the eavesdropper's information is no longer required. The protocol is extremely robust to modulation noise and highly loss-tolerant, which makes it a promising candidate for satellite-based continuous-variable quantum communication.

"  Deep radio observations of a wide region centred on the Hubble Deep Field South have been performed, providing one of the most sensitive set of radio observations acquired on the Australia Telescope Compact Array to date. A central rms of ~10 microJy is reached at four frequencies (1.4, 2.5, 5.2 and 8.7 GHz). In this paper the full source catalogues from the 2.5, 5.2 and 8.7 GHz observations are presented to complement Paper II, along with a detailed analysis of image quality and noise. We produce a consolidated catalogue by matching sources across all four frequencies of our survey. Radio spectral indices are used to investigate the nature of the radio sources and identify a number of sources with flat or inverted radio spectra, which indicates AGN activity. We also find several other interesting sources, including a broadline emitting radio galaxy, a giant radio galaxy and three Gigahertz Peaked Spectrum sources.

"  The observations of carbon isotopic ratios in evolved stars suggest that non standard mixing is acting in low mass stars as they are ascending the red giant branch. We propose a simple consistent mechanism, based on the most recent developments in the description of rotation-induced mixing by Zahn (1992), which simultaneously accounts for the low $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios in globular cluster and field Pop II giants and for the lithium abundances in metal-poor giant stars. It also leads to the destruction of $^3$He produced on the main sequence in low mass stars. This should both naturally account for the recent measurements of $^3$He/H in galactic HII regions and allow for high values of $^3$He observed in some planetary nebulae.

"  In this paper, we propose a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3DCNN) based multi-stream framework to recognize American Sign Language (ASL) manual signs (consisting of movements of the hands, as well as non-manual face movements in some cases) in real-time from RGB-D videos, by fusing multimodality features including hand gestures, facial expressions, and body poses from multi-channels (RGB, depth, motion, and skeleton joints). To learn the overall temporal dynamics in a video, a proxy video is generated by selecting a subset of frames for each video which are then used to train the proposed 3DCNN model. We collect a new ASL dataset, ASL-100-RGBD, which contains 42 RGB-D videos captured by a Microsoft Kinect V2 camera, each of 100 ASL manual signs, including RGB channel, depth maps, skeleton joints, face features, and HDface. The dataset is fully annotated for each semantic region (i.e. the time duration of each word that the human signer performs). Our proposed method achieves 92.88 accuracy for recognizing 100 ASL words in our newly collected ASL-100-RGBD dataset. The effectiveness of our framework for recognizing hand gestures from RGB-D videos is further demonstrated on the Chalearn IsoGD dataset and achieves 76 accuracy which is 5.51 higher than the state-of-the-art work in terms of average fusion by using only 5 channels instead of 12 channels in the previous work.

"  This manuscript is devoted to introduce a gauge theory of the Lorentz Group based on the ambiguity emerging in dealing with isometric diffeo-morphism-induced Lorentz transformations. The behaviors under local transformations of fermion fields and spin connections (assumed to be ordinary world vectors) are analyzed in flat space-time and the role of the torsion field, within the generalization to curved space-time, is briefly discussed. The fermion dynamics is then analyzed including the new gauge fields and assuming time-gauge. Stationary solutions of the problem are also analyzed in the non-relativistic limit, to study the spinor structure of an hydrogen-like atom. ",Fermion Dynamics by Internal and Space-Time Symmetries

"  We extend the so-called Kotani Theory for a particular class of ergodic matrix-like Jacobi operators defined in $l^{2}(\mathbb{Z}; \mathbb{C}^{l})$ by the law $[H_{\omega} \textbf{u}]_{n} := D^{*}(T^{n - 1}\omega) \textbf{u}_{n - 1} + D(T^{n}\omega) \textbf{u}_{n + 1} + V(T^{n}\omega) \textbf{u}_{n}$, where $T: \Omega \rightarrow \Omega$ is an ergodic automorphism in the measure space $(\Omega, \nu)$, the map $D: \Omega \rightarrow GL(l, \mathbb{R})$ is bounded, and for each $\omega\in\Omega$, $D(\omega)$ is symmetric. Namely, it is shown that for each $r\in\{1,\ldots,l\}$, the essential closure of $\mathcal{Z}_{r} := \{x \in \mathbb{R}\mid$ exactly $2r$ Lyapunov exponents of $A_z$ are zero$\}$ coincides with $\sigma_{ac,2r}(H_{\omega})$, the absolutely continuous spectrum of multiplicity $2r$, where $A_z$ is a Schr\""odinger-like cocycle induced by $H_\omega$. Moreover, if $k\in\{1,\ldots,2l\}$ is odd, then $\sigma_{ac,k}(H_{\omega})=\emptyset$ for $\nu$-a.e. $\omega\in\Omega$. We also provide a Thouless Formula for such class of operators.

"  Hydrocarbons are ubiquitous in the interstellar medium, observed in diverse environments ranging from diffuse to molecular dark clouds and strong photon-dominated regions near HII regions. Recently, two broad diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) at 4881{\AA} and 5450{\AA} were attributed to the linear version of propynylidene l-C3H2, a species whose more stable cyclic conformer c-C3H2 has been widely observed in the diffuse interstellar medium at radio wavelengths. This attribution has already been criticized on the basis of indirect plausibility arguments because the required column densities are quite large, N(l-C3H2)/EB-V = 4 \times 1014 cm-2 mag-1. Here we present new measurements of N(l-C3H2) based on simultaneous 18-21 GHz VLA absorption profiles of cyclic and linear C3H2 taken along sightlines toward extragalactic radiocontinuum background sources with foreground Galactic reddening EB-V = 0.1 - 1.6 mag. We find that N(l-C3H2)/N(c-C3H2) ? 1/15 - 1/40 and N(l-C3H2)/EB-V ? 2 \pm 1 \times 1011 cm-2 mag-1, so that the column densities of l-C3H2 needed to explain the diffuse interstellar bands are some three orders of magnitude higher than what is observed. We also find N(C4H)/EB-V < 1.3 \times 1013 cm-2 mag-1 and N(C4H-)/EB-V < 1 \times 1011 cm-2 mag-1 (3?). Using available data for CH and C2H we compare the abundances of small hydrocarbons in diffuse and dark clouds as a guide to their ability to contribute as DIB carriers over a wide range of conditions in the interstellar medium.

"  Uniformly finite homology is a coarse homology theory, defined via chains that satisfy a uniform boundedness condition. By construction, uniformly finite homology carries a canonical $\ell^\infty$-semi-norm. We show that, for uniformly discrete spaces of bounded geometry, this semi-norm on uniformly finite homology in degree 0 with integral coefficients allows for a new formulation of Whyte's rigidity result. In contrast, we prove that this semi-norm is trivial on uniformly finite homology in higher degrees with real coefficients. ",The $\ell^\infty$-semi-norm on uniformly finite homology
"  We revisit results concerning the connection between subspaces of a space and sublocales of its locale of open sets. The approach we present is based on the observation that for every locale $L$ its spatial sublocales $\mathsf{sp}[\mathsf{S}(L)]$ form a coframe which is isomorphic to the coframe $\mathsf{sob}[\mathcal{P}(\mathsf{pt}(L))]$ of sober subspaces of $\mathsf{pt}(L)$. We characterize the frames $L$ such that the spatial sublocales of $\mathsf{S}(L)$ perfectly represent the subspaces of $\mathsf{pt}(L)$. We prove choice-free, weak versions of the results by Niefield and Rosenthal characterizing those frames such that all their sublocales are spatial (i.e., those such that the sober subspaces of $\mathsf{pt}(L)$ perfectly represent the sublocales of $L$). We do so by using a notion of essential prime which does not rely on the existence of enough minimal primes above every element. We will re-prove Simmons' result that spaces such that the sublocales of $\Omega (X)$ perfectly represent their subspaces are exactly the scattered spaces. We will characterize scattered spaces in terms of a strong form of essentiality for primes. We apply these characterizations to show that, when $L$ is a spatial frame and a coframe, $\mathsf{pt}(L)$ is scattered if and only if it is $T_D$, and this holds if and only if all the primes of $L$ are completely prime.

"  The governing equations of Brownian rigid bodies that both translate and rotate are of interest in fields such as self-assembly of proteins, anisotropic colloids, dielectric theory, and liquid crystals. In this paper, the partial differential equation that describes the evolution of concentration is derived from the stochastic differential equation of a sphere experiencing Brownian motion in a viscous medium where a potential field may be present. The potential field may be either interactions between particles or applied externally. The derivation is performed once for particles whose orientation can be specified by a vector ($S^2$), and again for particles which require a rotation matrix ($SO(3)$). The derivation shows the important difference between probability density and concentration, the Ito and Stratonovich calculus, and a Piola-type identity is obtained to complete the derivation.

  We proposed an action of neutral fermions interacting with external electromagnetic fields to construct a 3+1 dimensional topological field theory as the effective action attained by integrating out the fermionic fields in the related path integral.

"  Universe models with compact spatial sections smaller than the observable universe produce a topological lens effect. Given a catalog of cosmic sources, we estimate the number of topological images in locally hyperbolic and locally elliptic spaces, as a function of the cosmological parameters, of the volume of the spatial sections and of the catalog depth. Next we apply the crystallographic method, aimed to detect a topological signal in the 3D distance histogram between images, to compact hyperbolic models. Numerical calculations in the Weeks manifold allows us to check the absence of crystallographic signature of topology, due to the fact that the number of copies of the fundamental domain in the observable covering space is low and that the points are not moved the same distance by the holonomies of space.

"  We ask the following question: Of the exact solutions to Einstein's equations extant in the literature, how many could represent the field associated with an isolated static spherically symmetric perfect fluid source? The candidate solutions were subjected to the following elementary tests: i) isotropy of the pressure, ii) regularity at the origin, iii) positive definiteness of the energy density and pressure at the origin, iv) vanishing of the pressure at some finite radius, v) monotonic decrease of the energy density and pressure with increasing radius, and vi) subluminal sound speed. A total of 127 candidate solutions were found. Only 16 of these passed all the tests. Of these 16, only 9 have a sound speed which monotonically decreases with radius.

"  We show that the ""puzzling"" chemical composition observed in the extremely metal poor star HE0107-5240 may be naturally explained by the concurrent pollution of at least two supernovae. In the simplest possible model a supernova of quite low mass (~15 Msun), underwent a ""normal"" explosion and ejected ~0.06 Msun of 56Ni while a second one was massive enough (~35 Msun) to experience a strong fall back that locked in a compact remnant all the carbon-oxygen core. In a more general scenario, the pristine gas clouds were polluted by one or more supernovae of relatively low mass (less than ~25 Msun). The successive explosion of a quite massive star experiencing an extended fall back would have largely raised the abundances of the light elements in its close neighborhood.

"  The most remarkable class of high-redshift objects observed so far is extended Ly$\alpha$ emission-line blobs found in an over-density region at redshift 3.1. They may be either a dust-enshrouded, extreme starburst galaxy with a large-scale galactic outflow (superwind) or cooling radiation from dark matter halos. Recently one of these Ly$\alpha$ blobs has been detected at submillimeter wavelengths (450 and 850 $\mu$m). Here we show that its rest-frame spectral energy distribution between optical and far-infrared is quite similar to that of Arp 220, which is a typical ultraluminous starburst/superwind galaxy in the local universe. This suggests strongly that the superwind model proposed by Taniguchi & Shioya is applicable to this Ly$\alpha$ blob. Since the blob is more luminous in the infrared by a factor of 30 than Arp 220, it comprises a new population of hyperwind galaxies at high redshift.

"  Motivated by recent experimental findings, we have developed a theory of the superconducting state for 2D metals without inversion symmetry modeling the geometry of a surface superconducting layer in a field-effect-transistor or near the boundary doped by adsorbed ions. In such systems the two-fold spin degeneracy is lifted by spin-orbit interaction, and singlet and triplet pairings are mixed in the wave function of the Cooper pairs. As a result, spin magnetic susceptibility becomes anisotropic and Knight shift retains finite and rather high value at T=0.

"  Even a single excess electron or ion migrating on the surface of sensitive explosives can catalyze their gradual exothermic decomposition. Mechanisms underlying such a charge-induced gradual thermal decomposition of highly sensitive explosives can be different. If sensitive explosive is a polar liquid, intense charge-dipole attraction between excess surface charges and surrounding explosive molecules can result in repetitive attempts of solvation of these charges by polar explosive molecules. Every attempt of such uncompleted nonequilibrium solvation causes local exothermic decomposition of thermolabile polar molecules accompanied by further thermal jumping unsolvated excess charges to new surface sites. Thus, ionized mobile hot spots emerge on charged explosive surface. Stochastic migration of ionized hot spots on explosive surface causes gradual exothermic decomposition of the whole mass of the polar explosive. The similar gradual charge-catalyzed exothermic decomposition of both polar and nonpolar highly sensitive explosives can be also caused by intense charge-dipole attacks of surrounding water vapor molecules electrostatically attracted from ambient humid air and strongly accelerated towards charged sites on explosive surfaces. Emission of electrons, photons and heat from ionized hot spots randomly migrating on charged surface of highly sensitive explosive aerosol nanoparticles converts such particles into the form of short-circuited thermionic nanobatteries.

"  We provide a simple and novel algorithmic design technique, for which we call iterative partial rounding, that gives a tight rounding-based approximation for vertex cover with hard capacities (VC-HC). In particular, we obtain an $f$-approximation for VC-HC on hypergraphs, improving over a previous results of Cheung et al (SODA 2014) to the tight extent. This also closes the gap of approximation since it was posted by Chuzhoy and Naor in (FOCS 2002). We believe that our rounding technique is of independence interests when hard constraints are considered.   Our main technical tool for establishing the approximation guarantee is a separation lemma that certifies the existence of a strong partition for solutions that are basic feasible in an extended version of the natural LP.

"  We compute and study the infrared and sub-mm properties of high redshift ($z \gtrsim 1$) simulated clusters and proto-clusters. The results of a large set of hydro-dynamical zoom-in simulations including active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback, have been treated with the recently developed radiative transfer code GRASIL-3D, which accounts for the effect of dust reprocessing in an arbitrary geometry. Here, we have slightly generalized the code to adapt it to the present purpose. Then we have post-processed boxes of physical size 2 Mpc encompassing each of the 24 most massive clusters identified at z=0, at several redshifts between 0.5 and 3, producing IR and sub-mm mock images of these regions and SEDs of the radiation coming out from them.   While this field is in its infancy from the observational point of view, rapid development is expected in the near future thanks to observations performed in the far IR and sub-mm bands. Notably, we find that in this spectral regime our prediction are little affected by the assumption required by this post-processing, and the emission is mostly powered by star formation rather than accretion onto super massive black hole (SMBH).   The comparison with the little observational information currently available, highlights that the simulated cluster regions never attain the impressive star formation rates suggested by these observations. This problem becomes more intriguing taking into account that the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) in the same simulations turn out to be too massive. It seems that the interplay between the feedback schemes and the star formation model should be revised, possibly incorporating a positive feedback mode.

"  [abridged] Previous analyses of lithium abundances in main sequence and red giant stars have revealed the action of mixing mechanisms other than convection in stellar interiors. Beryllium abundances in stars with lithium abundance determinations can offer valuable complementary information on the nature of these mechanisms. Our aim is to derive beryllium abundances along the whole evolutionary sequence of an open cluster, IC 4651. These Be abundances are used together with previously determined Li abundances, in the same sample stars, to investigate the mixing mechanisms in a range of stellar masses and evolutionary stages. New beryllium abundances are determined from high-resolution, high signal-to-noise UVES spectra using spectrum synthesis and model atmospheres. The careful synthetic modelling of the Be lines region is used to calculate reliable abundances in rapidly rotating stars. The observed behavior of Be and Li is compared to theoretical predictions from stellar models including rotation-induced mixing, internal gravity waves, atomic diffusion, and thermohaline mixing. Beryllium is detected in all the main sequence and turn-off sample stars, both slow- and fast-rotating stars, including the Li-dip stars, but was not detected in the red giants. Confirming previous results, we find that the Li dip is also a Be dip, although the depletion of Be is more modest than that of Li in the corresponding effective temperature range. For post-main-sequence stars, the Be dilution starts earlier within the Hertzsprung gap than expected from classical predictions as does the Li dilution. A clear dispersion in the Be abundances is also observed. Theoretical stellar models including the hydrodynamical transport processes mentioned above are able to reproduce well all the observed features.

  Recent developments for chiral and $U(1)_A$ restorations in excited hadrons are reviewed. We emphasize predictions of the chiral symmetry restoration scenario for axial charges and couplings to Goldstone bosons. Using very general chiral symmetry arguments it is shown that strict chiral restoration in a given excited nucleon forbids its decay into the $N \pi$ channel. We confront this prediction with the $N^*N\pi$ coupling constants extracted from the decay widths and observe a 100 % correlation of these data with the spectroscopic parity doublet patterns. These results suggest that the lowest approximate chiral parity doublet is the $N(1440) - N(1535)$ pair. In the meson sector we discuss predictions of the chiral symmetry restoration for still missing states and a signature of the higher symmetry observed in new $\bar p p$ data. We conclude with the exactly solvable chirally symmetric and confining model that can be considered as a generalization of the 1+1 dimensional 't Hooft model to 4 dimensions. Complete spectra of $\bar q q$ mesons demonstrate a fast chiral restoration with increasing $J$ and a slow one with increasing $n$. ,QCD symmetries in excited hadrons
"  Integrated assessment models (IAMs) are valuable tools that consider the interactions between socioeconomic systems and the climate system. Decision-makers and policy analysts employ IAMs to calculate the marginalized monetary cost of climate damages resulting from an incremental emission of a greenhouse gas. Used within the context of regulating anthropogenic methane emissions, this metric is called the social cost of methane (SC-CH$_4$). Because several key IAMs used for social cost estimation contain a simplified model structure that prevents the endogenous modeling of non-CO$_2$ greenhouse gases, very few estimates of the SC-CH$_4$ exist. For this reason, IAMs should be updated to better represent methane cycle dynamics that are consistent with comprehensive Earth System Models. We include feedbacks of climate change on the methane cycle to estimate the SC-CH$_4$. Our expected value for the SC-CH$_4$ is \$1163/t-CH$_4$ under a constant 3.0% discount rate. This represents a 44% increase relative to a mean estimate without feedbacks on the methane cycle. ",Including climate system feedbacks in calculations of the social cost of   methane
"  An resilience optimal evaluation of financial portfolios implies having plausible hypotheses about the multiple interconnections between the macroeconomic variables and the risk parameters. In this paper, we propose a graphical model for the reconstruction of the causal structure that links the multiple macroeconomic variables and the assessed risk parameters, it is this structure that we call Stress Testing Network (STN). In this model, the relationships between the macroeconomic variables and the risk parameter define a ""relational graph"" among their time-series, where related time-series are connected by an edge. Our proposal is based on the temporal causal models, but unlike, we incorporate specific conditions in the structure which correspond to intrinsic characteristics this type of networks. Using the proposed model and given the high-dimensional nature of the problem, we used regularization methods to efficiently detect causality in the time-series and reconstruct the underlying causal structure. In addition, we illustrate the use of model in credit risk data of a portfolio. Finally, we discuss its uses and practical benefits in stress testing.

"  We report photoemission studies of polycrystalline samples of Sr-doped GdTiO_{3+delta}, which undergoes a Mott-Hubbard-like metal-insulator transition at a Ti-concentration of about 20%. The Ti 3d-derived valence band near the Fermi level displays a two-peak structure consistent with a Hubbard-model-type interpretation as quasiparticle and lower Hubbard band. Contrary to the theoretical expectation the lower Hubbard band does not change its energy with doping. However, the analysis of the core level spectra and elemental mapping with a scanning electron microscope indicate a strongly inhomogeneous doping concentration in the probed surface regions. This questions the intrinsic character of the valence band spectra and demonstrates a general difficulty when using polycrystalline samples for such studies.

"  The celebrated Hartman effect, according to which, the tunneling time through a opaque barrier is independent of the width of the barrier for a sufficiently thick barrier, is not well understood theoretically and experimentally till today. In this work we attempt to through some light to understand the mystery behind this paradoxical result of tunneling .For this purpose we calculate the tunneling time from a layered non-Hermitian system to examine the effect of $PT$-symmetry over tunneling time. We explicitly find that for system respecting $PT$-symmetry, the tunneling time saturates with the thickness of the $PT$-symmetric barrier and thus shows the existence of Hartman effect. For non PT-symmetric case, the tunneling time depends upon the thickness of the barrier and Hartman effect is lost. We further consider the limiting case in which the non-Hermitian system reduces to the real barrier to show that the Hartman effect from a real barrier is due to $PT$-symmetry (of the corresponding non-Hermitian system) .

"  Utility (e.g., sum-rate) maximization for multiantenna broadcast and interference channels (with one antenna at the receivers) is known to be in general a non-convex problem, if one limits the scope to linear (beamforming) strategies at transmitter and receivers. In this paper, it is shown that, under some standard assumptions, most notably that the utility function is decreasing with the interference levels at the receivers, a global optimal solution can be found with reduced complexity via a suitably designed Branch-and-Bound method. Although infeasible for real-time implementation, this procedure enables a non-heuristic and systematic assessment of suboptimal techniques. A suboptimal strategy is then proposed that, when applied to sum-rate maximization, reduces to the well-known distributed pricing techniques. Finally, numerical results are provided that compare global optimal solutions with suboptimal (pricing) techniques for sum-rate maximization problems, leading to insight into issues such as the robustness against bad initializations.

"  I determine the expansion of the supernova remnant of SN1604 (Kepler's supernova) based on archival Chandra ACIS-S observations made in 2000 and 2006. The measurements were done in several distinct energy bands, and were made for the remnant as a whole, and for six individual sectors. The average expansion parameter indicates that the remnant expands as $r \propto t^{0.5}$, but there are significant differences in different parts of the remnant: the bright northwestern part expands as $r \propto t^{0.35}$, whereas the rest of the remnant's expansion shows an expansion $r \propto t^{0.6}$. The latter is consistent with an explosion in which the outer part of the ejecta has a negative power law slope for density ($\rho \propto v^{-n}$) of $n=7$, or with an exponential density profile($\rho \propto \exp(-v/v_e)$). The expansion parameter in the southern region, in conjunction with the shock radius, indicate a rather low value (<5E50 erg) for the explosion energy of SN1604 for a distance of 4 kpc. An higher explosion energy is consistent with the results, if the distance is larger.   The filament in the eastern part of the remnant, which is dominated by X-ray synchrotron radiation seems to mark a region with a fast shock speed $r \propto t^{0.7}$, corresponding to a shock velocity of v= 4200 km/s, for a distance to SN1604 of 4 kpc. This is consistent with the idea that X-ray synchrotron emission requires shock velocities in excess of ~2000 km/s.   The X-ray based expansion measurements reported are consistent with results based on optical and radio measurements, but disagree with previous X-ray measurements based on ROSAT and Einstein observations.

"  It is well-known that simple type theory is complete with respect to non-standard set-valued models. Completeness for standard models only holds with respect to certain extended classes of models, e.g., the class of cartesian closed categories. Similarly, dependent type theory is complete for locally cartesian closed categories. However, it is usually difficult to establish the coherence of interpretations of dependent type theory, i.e., to show that the interpretations of equal expressions are indeed equal. Several classes of models have been used to remedy this problem. We contribute to this investigation by giving a semantics that is standard, coherent, and sufficiently general for completeness while remaining relatively easy to compute with. Our models interpret types of Martin-L\""of's extensional dependent type theory as sets indexed over posets or, equivalently, as fibrations over posets. This semantics can be seen as a generalization to dependent type theory of the interpretation of intuitionistic first-order logic in Kripke models. This yields a simple coherent model theory, with respect to which simple and dependent type theory are sound and complete. ","Kripke Semantics for Martin-L\""of's Extensional Type Theory"

"  Purpose: To evaluate the influence of ADMIRE algorithm on image texture and image visual impression as a supplement to measurements of common image quality parameters such as noise levels and spatial resolution. Methods: An ACR phantom was examined at different radiation dose levels. To characterize the image texture, two Haralick texture parameters, contrast and entropy, for different dose level and reconstruction algorithms were assessed. The visual impression of images and their structural differences were evaluated using the structural similarity index (SSIM). Noise was determined for all dose and AMIRE levels and compared to those by filtered back projection (FBP). The spatial resolution was determined by the modulation transfer functions and the line spread function. Results: The Haralick texture parameters decreased with increasing ADMIRE levels I up to V. ADMIRE III, IV and V offered a comparable contrast and entropy to those calculated by FBP with a radiation dose reduction up to 50%. SSIM improved with increasing ADMIRE levels. SSIM calculated by ADMIRE IV and V showed similar values by the filter back projection with a dose decrease up to 50%. Spatial resolution was retained up to 90% dose reduction. With increasing ADMIRE as well as dose level the noise distribution shifted to a more narrow distribution, which was in accordance with the reconstructed images using ADMIRE. Conclusion: Texture analysis and SSIM allow a more realistic assessment of the dose reduction potential of iterative reconstruction algorithms than quality metrics only based on physical measurements of noise distribution or spatial resolution. This work presented that by means of the ADMIRE algorithm, a comparable image quality at reduced radiation doses can be reached.

"  We study the effect of impermeable boundaries on the symmetry properties of a random passive scalar field advected by random flows. We focus on a broad class of nonlinear shear flows multiplied by a stationary, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) time varying process, including some of their limiting cases, such as Gaussian white noise or plug flows. For the former case with linear shear, recent studies \cite{camassa2019symmetry} numerically demonstrated that the decaying passive scalar's long time limiting probability distribution function (PDF) could be negatively skewed in the presence of impermeable channel boundaries, in contrast to rigorous results in free space which established the limiting PDF is positively skewed \cite{mclaughlin1996explicit}. Here, the role of boundaries in setting the long time limiting skewness of the PDF is established rigorously for the above class using the long time asymptotic expansion of the $N$-point correlator of the random field obtained from the ground state eigenvalue perturbation approach proposed in \cite{bronski1997scalar}. Our analytical result verifies the conclusion for the linear shear flow obtained from numerical simulations in \cite{camassa2019symmetry}. Moreover, we demonstrate that the limiting distribution is negatively skewed for any shear flow at sufficiently low P\'eclet number. We show that the long time limit of the first three moments depends explicitly on the value of $\gamma$, which is in contrast to the conclusion in \cite{vanden2001non} for the limiting PDF in free space. We derive the exact formula of the $N$-point correlator for a flow with no spatial dependence and Gaussian temporal fluctuation, generalizing the results of \cite{bronski2007explicit}. The long time analysis of this formula is consistent with our theory for a general shear flow. All results are verified by Monte-Carlo simulations.

"  This paper investigates the principles of embedding learning to tackle the challenging semi-supervised video object segmentation. Unlike previous practices that focus on exploring the embedding learning of foreground object (s), we consider background should be equally treated. Thus, we propose a Collaborative video object segmentation by Foreground-Background Integration (CFBI) approach. CFBI separates the feature embedding into the foreground object region and its corresponding background region, implicitly promoting them to be more contrastive and improving the segmentation results accordingly. Moreover, CFBI performs both pixel-level matching processes and instance-level attention mechanisms between the reference and the predicted sequence, making CFBI robust to various object scales. Based on CFBI, we introduce a multi-scale matching structure and propose an Atrous Matching strategy, resulting in a more robust and efficient framework, CFBI+. We conduct extensive experiments on two popular benchmarks, i.e., DAVIS and YouTube-VOS. Without applying any simulated data for pre-training, our CFBI+ achieves the performance (J&F) of 82.9% and 82.8%, outperforming all the other state-of-the-art methods.

"  The way to infer well-supported phylogenetic trees that precisely reflect the evolutionary process is a challenging task that completely depends on the way the related core genes have been found. In previous computational biology studies, many similarity based algorithms, mainly dependent on calculating sequence alignment matrices, have been proposed to find them. In these kinds of approaches, a significantly high similarity score between two coding sequences extracted from a given annotation tool means that one has the same genes. In a previous work article, we presented a quality test approach (QTA) that improves the core genes quality by combining two annotation tools (namely NCBI, a partially human-curated database, and DOGMA, an efficient annotation algorithm for chloroplasts). This method takes the advantages from both sequence similarity and gene features to guarantee that the core genome contains correct and well-clustered coding sequences (\emph{i.e.}, genes). We then show in this article how useful are such well-defined core genes for biomolecular phylogenetic reconstructions, by investigating various subsets of core genes at various family or genus levels, leading to subtrees with strong bootstraps that are finally merged in a well-supported supertree.

"  We study the gamma-ray emission patterns and light curves in dissipative pulsar magnetospheres. We produce the gamma-ray light curves by using the geometric method and the particle trajectory method. For the geometric method, assuming the gamma-ray emission originates in a finite-width layer along the last closed lines, we generate the gamma-ray light curves based on the uniform emissivity along the magnetic field lines in the comoving frame (CF). For the particle trajectory method, we consider the spatial distribution of conductivity $\sigma$ by assuming a very high conductivity within the light cylinder and a finite conductivity outside the light cylinder (LC). Assuming that all the $\gamma$-ray emission originates in the outer magnetosphere outside the LC, we generate the gamma-ray light curves by computing realistic particle trajectories and Lorentz factors, taking into account both the accelerating electric field and curvature radiation loss. Further, we compare the modeling light curves to the observed light curves at $>0.1\, \rm GeV$ energies for Vela pulsar. Our results show that the magnetosphere with the low $\sigma$ value is more preferred for the geometric method. However, the magnetosphere with a near force-free regime within the LC and a high $\sigma$ value outside the LC is more favored for the particle trajectory method. It is noted that the particle trajectory method uses the parallel electric fields that are self-consistent with the magnetic fields of the magnetosphere. We suggest that the results from the particle trajectory method are more supported on the physical ground. ",Modeling gamma-ray light curves with more realistic pulsar   magnetospheres

"  We introduce an algorithm for the efficient computation of the continuous Haar transform of 2D patterns that can be described by polygons. These patterns are ubiquitous in VLSI processes where they are used to describe design and mask layouts. There, speed is of paramount importance due to the magnitude of the problems to be solved and hence very fast algorithms are needed. We show that by techniques borrowed from computational geometry we are not only able to compute the continuous Haar transform directly, but also to do it quickly. This is achieved by massively pruning the transform tree and thus dramatically decreasing the computational load when the number of vertices is small, as is the case for VLSI layouts. We call this new algorithm the pruned continuous Haar transform. We implement this algorithm and show that for patterns found in VLSI layouts the proposed algorithm was in the worst case as fast as its discrete counterpart and up to 12 times faster.

"  Voltages above a hundred kilo-volt will be required to generate the drift field of future very large liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers. The most delicate component is the feedthrough whose role is to safely deliver the very high voltage to the cathode through the thick insulating walls of the cryostat without compromising the purity of the argon inside. This requires a feedthrough that is typically meters long and carefully designed to be vacuum tight and have small heat input. Furthermore, all materials should be carefully chosen to allow operation in cryogenic conditions. In addition, electric fields in liquid argon should be kept below a threshold to reduce risks of discharges. The combination of all above requirements represents significant challenges from the design and manufacturing perspective. In this paper, we report on the successful operation of a feedthrough satisfying all the above requirements. The details of the feedthrough design and its manufacturing steps are provided. Very high voltages up to unprecedented voltages of -300 kV could be applied during long periods repeatedly. A source of instability was observed, which was specific to the setup configuration which was used for the test and not due to the feedthrough itself.

A comparison of the fast XMM-Newton follow-up and the late Chandra observations shows a significant difference in those parameters, likely produced by a transition from jet expansion taking place between two and ten days after the burst. We do not observe a significant shrinking of the luminosity distribution when we correct for beaming; more burst observations are needed to confirm this result. We also compare our results with those obtained by BeppoSAX and SWIFT; there is no strong discrepancy between the afterglow fluxes observed with these satellites when we carefully take into account the different median observation time of each observatory.

"  In single image deblurring, the ""coarse-to-fine"" scheme, i.e. gradually restoring the sharp image on different resolutions in a pyramid, is very successful in both traditional optimization-based methods and recent neural-network-based approaches. In this paper, we investigate this strategy and propose a Scale-recurrent Network (SRN-DeblurNet) for this deblurring task. Compared with the many recent learning-based approaches in [25], it has a simpler network structure, a smaller number of parameters and is easier to train.

"  The scientific literature is a large information network linking various actors (laboratories, companies, institutions, etc.). The vast amount of data generated by this network constitutes a dynamic heterogeneous attributed network (HAN), in which new information is constantly produced and from which it is increasingly difficult to extract content of interest. In this article, I present my first thesis works in partnership with an industrial company, Digital Scientific Research Technology. This later offers a scientific watch tool, Peerus, addressing various issues, such as the real time recommendation of newly published papers or the search for active experts to start new collaborations. To tackle this diversity of applications, a common approach consists in learning representations of the nodes and attributes of this HAN and use them as features for a variety of recommendation tasks. However, most works on attributed network embedding pay too little attention to textual attributes and do not fully take advantage of recent natural language processing techniques. Moreover, proposed methods that jointly learn node and document representations do not provide a way to effectively infer representations for new documents for which network information is missing, which happens to be crucial in real time recommender systems. Finally, the interplay between textual and graph data in text-attributed heterogeneous networks remains an open research direction.

"  An excess of X-ray emission below 1 keV, called soft excess, is detected in a large fraction of Seyfert 1-1.5s. The origin of this feature remains debated, as several models have been suggested to explain it, including warm Comptonization and blurred ionized reflection. In order to constrain the origin of this component, we exploit the different behaviors of these models above 10 keV. Ionized reflection covers a broad energy range, from the soft X-rays to the hard X-rays, while Comptonization drops very quickly in the soft X-rays. We present here the results of a study done on 102 Seyfert 1s (Sy 1.0, 1.2, 1.5 and NLSy1) from the Swift/BAT 70-Month Hard X-ray Survey catalog. The joint spectral analysis of Swift/BAT and XMM-Newton data allows a hard X-ray view of the soft excess that is present in about 80% of the objects of our sample. We discuss how the soft-excess strength is linked to the reflection at high energy, to the photon index of the primary continuum and to the Eddington ratio. In particular, we find a positive dependence of the soft-excess intensity on the Eddington ratio. We compare our results to simulations of blurred ionized-reflection models and show that they are in contradiction. By stacking both XMM-Newton and Swift/BAT spectra per soft-excess strength, we see that the shape of reflection at hard X-rays stays constant when the soft excess varies, showing an absence of link between reflection and soft excess. We conclude that the ionized-reflection model as the origin of the soft excess is disadvantaged in favor of the warm Comptonization model in our sample of Seyfert 1s.

"  The usual description of self-induced flavor conversions for neutrinos (\nu's) in supernovae is based on the simplified assumption that all the \nu's of the different species are emitted ""half-isotropically"" by a common neutrinosphere, in analogy to a blackbody emission. However, realistic supernova simulations show that \nu angular distributions at decoupling are far from being half-isotropic and, above all, are flavor-dependent. We show that flavor-dependent angular distributions may lead to crossing points in the angular spectra of different \nu species (where F_{\nu_e}=F_{\nu_x} and F_{{\bar\nu}_e}=F_{{\bar\nu}_x}) around which a new multi-angle instability can develop. To characterize this effect, we carry out a linearized flavor stability analysis for different SN neutrino angular distributions. We find that this instability can shift the onset of the flavor conversions toward low-radii and produce a smearing of the splitting features found with trivial $\nu$ emission models. As a result the spectral differences among \nu's of different flavors could be strongly reduced. ",Instability in the dense supernova neutrino gas with flavor-dependent   angular distributions
"  Middle-aged, cooling neutron stars are observed both as relatively rapidly spinning radio pulsars and as more slowly spinning, strongly magnetized isolated neutron stars (INSs), which stand out by their thermal X-ray spectra. The difference between the two classes may be that the INSs initially had much stronger magnetic fields, which decayed. To test this, we used the Chandra X-ray Observatory to observe 1RXS J072559.8-261229, a possible X-ray counterpart to PSR J0726-2612, which, with its 3.44s period and 3e13G inferred magnetic field strength, is the nearest and least extincted among the possible slowly-spinning, strong-field INS progenitors (it likely is in the Gould Belt, at ~1 kpc). We confirm the identification and find that the pulsar has a spectrum consistent with being purely thermal, with blackbody temperature kT=87+/-5 eV and radius R=5.7+2.6-1.3 km at a distance of 1 kpc. We detect sinusoidal pulsations at twice the radio period with a semi-amplitude of 27\pm5%. The properties of PSR J0726-2612 strongly resemble those of the INSs, except for its much shorter characteristic age of 200 kyr (instead of several Myr). We conclude that PSR J0726-2612 is indeed an example of a young INS, one that started with a magnetic field strength on the low end of those inferred for the INSs, and that, therefore, decayed by a relatively small amount. Our results suggest that the long-period, strong-field pulsars and the INSs are members of the same class, and open up new opportunities to understand the puzzling X-ray and optical emission of the INSs through radio observations of PSR J0726-2612.

"  Momentum-dependent excitation spectra of the two-dimensional Hubbard model on the square lattice have been investigated at zero temperature on the basis of the full self-consistent projection operator method in order to clarify nonlocal effects of electron correlations on the spectra. It is found that intersite antiferromagnetic correlations cause shadow bands and enhance the Mott-Hubbard splittings near the half-filling. Furthermore nonlocal excitations are shown to move the critical doping concentration $\delta^{\ast}_{h}$, at which the singular quasiparticle peak is located just on the Fermi level, from $\delta^{\ast}_{h}=0.153$ (the single-site value) to $\delta^{\ast}_{h}=0.123$. The latter suggests the occurance of an instability such as the stripe at $\delta^{\ast}_{h}=1/8$. ",Nonlocal Excitations and 1/8 Singularity in Cuprates
"  We summarize the mathematical basis and practical hints for the explicit analytical computation of spectral sums that involve the eigenvalues of the Laplace operator in simple domains. Such spectral sums appear as spectral expansions of heat kernels, survival probabilities, first-passage time densities, and reaction rates in many diffusion-oriented applications. As the eigenvalues are determined by zeros of an appropriate linear combination of a Bessel function and its derivative, there are powerful analytical tools for computing such spectral sums. We discuss three main strategies: representations of meromorphic functions as sums of partial fractions, Fourier-Bessel and Dini series, and direct evaluation of the Laplace-transformed heat kernels. The major emphasis is put on a pedagogic introduction, the practical aspects of these strategies, their advantages and limitations.

"  We present the first model independent determination of S- and P-wave helicity amplitudes from CERN measurements of pi(-)p -> pi(-)pi(+)n on polarized target at small t and dipion masses 580-1080 MeV. The purely analytical determination of the helicity amplitudes is made possible by our finding analytical solution for relative phase omega_ij between S-wave amplitudes S_d and S_u of opposite transversity for each set of solutions for transversity amplitudes A_u(i), A_d(j),i,j=1,2. Of the six possible solutions for omega_ij only the solution with omega_ij=pi yields physical helicity amplitudes. Assigning rho^0(770) phase to the dominant P-wave helicity flip amplitude L_1(ij) necessitates a phase of the S-wave helicity flip amplitude S_1(ij) that is near to the rho^0(770) phase.These two amplitudes are consistent with rho^0(770)-f_0(980) mixing. The relative phases omega_ij=pi satisfy certain selfconsistency relation that must be satisfied in order for the four sets of solutions A_u(i),A_d(j),i,j=1,2 to be all physical solutions that can be identified with coevolution amplitudes describing the interaction of the pion creation process with a quantum environment. This test on phases omega_ij provides a new test of Kraus representation of the mixed final state density matrix. We show that the probabilities p_ij determining the final state rho_f in terms of solution states rho_f(ij) can be determined in measurements of recoil hyperon polarization in pi(-)p->pi(-)K(+)Lambda0 on polarized target.

This is in contrast with the most widely used MTL CNN structures which empirically or heuristically share features on some specific layers (e.g., share all the features except the last convolutional layer). The proposed layerwise feature fusing scheme is formulated by combining existing CNN components in a novel way, with clear mathematical interpretability as discriminative dimensionality reduction, which is referred to as Neural Discriminative Dimensionality Reduction (NDDR). Specifically, we first concatenate features with the same spatial resolution from different tasks according to their channel dimension. Then, we show that the discriminative dimensionality reduction can be fulfilled by 1x1 Convolution, Batch Normalization, and Weight Decay in one CNN. The use of existing CNN components ensures the end-to-end training and the extensibility of the proposed NDDR layer to various state-of-the-art CNN architectures in a ""plug-and-play"" manner. The detailed ablation analysis shows that the proposed NDDR layer is easy to train and also robust to different hyperparameters. Experiments on different task sets with various base network architectures demonstrate the promising performance and desirable generalizability of our proposed method. The code of our paper is available at https://github.com/ethanygao/NDDR-CNN. ",NDDR-CNN: Layerwise Feature Fusing in Multi-Task CNNs by Neural   Discriminative Dimensionality Reduction

"  We consider $u(x,t)$, a solution of $\partial_tu = \Delta u + |u|^{p-1}u$ which blows up at some time $T > 0$, where $u:\mathbb{R}^N \times[0,T) \to \mathbb{R}$, $p > 1$ and $(N-2)p < N+2$. Define $S \subset \mathbb{R}^N$ to be the blow-up set of $u$, that is the set of all blow-up points. Under suitable nondegeneracy conditions, we show that if $S$ contains a $(N-\ell)$-dimensional continuum for some $\ell \in \{1,\dots, N-1\}$, then $S$ is in fact a $\mathcal{C}^2$ manifold. The crucial step is to derive a refined asymptotic behavior of $u$ near blow-up. In order to obtain such a refined behavior, we have to abandon the explicit profile function as a first order approximation and take a non-explicit function as a first order description of the singular behavior. This way we escape logarithmic scales of the variable $(T-t)$ and reach significant small terms in the polynomial order $(T-t)^\mu$ for some $\mu > 0$. The refined asymptotic behavior yields geometric constraints of the blow-up set, leading to more regularity on $S$.

  Two goodness-of-fit tests for copulas are being investigated. The first one deals with the case of elliptical copulas and the second one deals with independent copulas. These tests result from the expansion of the projection pursuit methodology we will introduce in the present article. This method enables us to determine on which axis system these copulas lie as well as the exact value of these very copulas in the basis formed by the axes previously determined irrespective of their value in their canonical basis. Simulations are also presented as well as an application to real datasets. ,Goodness-of-fit Tests For Elliptical And Independent Copulas Through   Projection Pursuit
"  Conventional likelihood-based information criteria for model selection rely on the distribution assumption of data. However, for complex data that are increasingly available in many scientific fields, the specification of their underlying distribution turns out to be challenging, and the existing criteria may be limited and are not general enough to handle a variety of model selection problems. Here, we propose a robust and consistent model selection criterion based upon the empirical likelihood function which is data-driven. In particular, this framework adopts plug-in estimators that can be achieved by solving external estimating equations, not limited to the empirical likelihood, which avoids potential computational convergence issues and allows versatile applications, such as generalized linear models, generalized estimating equations, penalized regressions and so on. The formulation of our proposed criterion is initially derived from the asymptotic expansion of the marginal likelihood under variable selection framework, but more importantly, the consistent model selection property is established under a general context. Extensive simulation studies confirm the out-performance of the proposal compared to traditional model selection criteria. Finally, an application to the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study illustrates the practical value of this proposed framework.

"  It is widely agreed that studying the 21 cm emission line from neutral hydrogen may be our best hope for understanding the creation of the first structures during the dark ages and the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). This hyperfine transition occurs as a result of the spin-spin interaction between the electron and the proton in hydrogen: The energy of the parallel spins (triplet) state is greater than that of the anti-parallel spins (singlet). This transition is strongly banned, with a transition probability of $2.6 \times 10^{-15} \mathrm{s}^{-1}$ being exceedingly low. Despite its low chance, the 21 cm hyperfine transition is one of the most important tools in observational astronomy due to the abundance of hydrogen in the Universe. The relative occupation number of the ground state and the occupation number of the excited state determine the strength of the 21 cm emission or absorption. Collisions or the so-called Wouthuysen-Field effect can both excite the 21 cm line. In this article, we give a brief review of the basic physics of 21 cm emission and highlight the current main worldwide 21 cm signal experiments. We also discuss several related concepts in astronomy and cosmology with these observations. ",Searching for the hydrogen 21 cm line in cosmos

"  Given two disjoint copies of a graph $G$, denoted $G^1$ and $G^2$, and a permutation $\pi$ of $V(G)$, the graph $\pi G$ is constructed by joining $u \in V(G^1)$ to $\pi(u) \in V(G^2)$ for all $u \in V(G^1)$. $G$ is said to be a universal fixer if the domination number of $\pi G$ is equal to the domination number of $G$ for all $\pi$ of $V(G)$.

"  We report the results of the Swift and XMM observations of the Swift-discovered long Gamma-Ray Burst GRB 060729 ($T_{90}$=115s). The afterglow of this burst was exceptionally bright in X-rays as well as at UV/Optical wavelengths showing an unusually long slow decay phase ($\alpha$=0.14\plm0.02) suggesting a larger energy injection phase at early times than in other bursts. The X-ray light curve displays a break at about 60 ks after the burst. The X-ray decay slope after the break is $\alpha$=1.29\plm0.03. Up to 125 days after the burst we do not detect a jet break, suggesting that the jet opening angle is larger than 28 degrees. In the first 2 minutes after the burst (rest frame) the X-ray spectrum of the burst changed dramatically from a hard X-ray spectrum to a very soft one. We find that the X-ray spectra at this early phase can all be fitted by an absorbed single power law model or alternatively by a blackbody plus power law model. The power law fits show that the X-ray spectrum becomes steeper while the absorption column density decreases. In Swift's UV/Optical telescope the afterglow was clearly detected up to 9 days after the burst in all 6 filters and even longer in some of the UV filters with the latest detection in the UVW1 31 days after the burst. A break at about 50 ks is clearly detected in all 6 UVOT filters from a shallow decay slope of about 0.3 and a steeper decay slope of 1.3.

"  We compare quasar selection techniques based on their optical variability using data from the Catalina Real-time Transient Survey (CRTS). We introduce a new technique based on Slepian wavelet variance (SWV) that shows comparable or better performance to structure functions and damped random walk models but with fewer assumptions. Combining these methods with WISE mid-IR colors produces a highly efficient quasar selection technique which we have validated spectroscopically. The SWV technique also identifies characteristic timescales in a time series and we find a characteristic rest frame timescale of ~54 days, confirmed in the light curves of ~18000 quasars from CRTS, SDSS and MACHO data, and anticorrelated with absolute magnitude. This indicates a transition between a damped random walk and $P(f) \propto f^{-1/3}$ behaviours and is the first strong indication that a damped random walk model may be too simplistic to describe optical quasar variability.

"  This paper presents a semi-quantitative mathematical model of the changes over time in the statistical distribution of well-being of individuals in a society. The model predicts that when individuals overvalue the more socially conspicuous aspects of well-being in their lifestyle choices, then the average well-being of the overall population may experience continuous decline. In addition to trade-off cost and overvaluation, we identify statistical variation in individuals' well-being and turnover within the population as key factors driving negative trends. We investigate the influence of the effects of heterogeneity in the population, as well as economic and/or technological progress.

"  We constrain the matter density $\Omega_{\mathrm{m}}$ and the amplitude of density fluctuations $\sigma_8$ within the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model with shear peak statistics and angular convergence power spectra using mass maps constructed from the first three years of data of the Dark Energy Survey (DES Y3). We use tomographic shear peak statistics, including cross-peaks: peak counts calculated on maps created by taking a harmonic space product of the convergence of two tomographic redshift bins. Our analysis follows a forward-modelling scheme to create a likelihood of these statistics using N-body simulations, using a Gaussian process emulator. We include the following lensing systematics: multiplicative shear bias, photometric redshift uncertainty, and galaxy intrinsic alignment. Stringent scale cuts are applied to avoid biases from unmodelled baryonic physics. We find that the additional non-Gaussian information leads to a tightening of the constraints on the structure growth parameter yielding $S_8~\equiv~\sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_{\mathrm{m}}/0.3}~=~0.797_{-0.013}^{+0.015}$ (68% confidence limits), with a precision of 1.8%, an improvement of ~38% compared to the angular power spectra only case. The results obtained with the angular power spectra and peak counts are found to be in agreement with each other and no significant difference in $S_8$ is recorded. We find a mild tension of $1.5 \thinspace \sigma$ between our study and the results from Planck 2018, with our analysis yielding a lower $S_8$. Furthermore, we observe that the combination of angular power spectra and tomographic peak counts breaks the degeneracy between galaxy intrinsic alignment $A_{\mathrm{IA}}$ and $S_8$, improving cosmological constraints. We run a suite of tests concluding that our results are robust and consistent with the results from other studies using DES Y3 data.

When ${\bf k} = {\mathbb C}$, these invariants are used to determine when an orbit of a real form of $G$ and an orbit of a Borel subgroup of $G$ have non-empty intersection in $\B$. We also characterize the invariants in terms of admissible paths in the set of $K$-orbits in $\B$. ",On some invariants of orbits in the flag variety under a symmetric   subgroup
"  Models of the decoupling of baryons and photons during the recombination epoch predict the existence of a large-scale velocity offset between baryons and dark matter at later times, the so-called streaming velocity. In this paper, we use high resolution numerical simulations to investigate the impact of this streaming velocity on the spin and shape distributions of high-redshift minihalos, the formation sites of the earliest generation of stars. We find that the presence of a streaming velocity has a negligible effect on the spin and shape of the dark matter component of the minihalos. However, it strongly affects the behaviour of the gas component. The most probable spin parameter increases from $\sim$0.03 in the absence of streaming to $\sim$0.15 for a run with a streaming velocity of three times $\sigma_{\rm rms}$, corresponding to 1.4 km\,s$^{-1}{}$ at redshift $z=15$. The gas within the minihalos becomes increasingly less spherical and more oblate as the streaming velocity increases, with dense clumps being found at larger distances from the halo centre. The impact of the streaming velocity is also mass-dependent: less massive objects are influenced more strongly, on account of their shallower potential wells. The number of halos in which gas cooling and runaway gravitational collapse occurs decreases substantially as the streaming velocity increases. However, the spin and shape distributions of gas that does manage to cool and collapse are insensitive to the value of the streaming velocity and we therefore do not expect the properties of the stars that formed from this collapsed gas to depend on the value of the streaming velocity. The spin and shape of this central gas clump are uncorrelated with the same properties measured on the scale of the halo as a whole. ",Shape and Spin of Minihaloes.

"  Excluding irrelevant features in a pattern recognition task plays an important role in maintaining a simpler machine learning model and optimizing the computational efficiency. Nowadays with the rise of large scale datasets, feature selection is in great demand as it becomes a central issue when facing high-dimensional datasets. The present study provides a new measure of saliency for features by employing a Sensitivity Analysis (SA) technique called the extended Fourier amplitude sensitivity test, and a well-trained Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) model, which ultimately leads to the selection of a promising optimal feature subset. Ideas of the paper are mainly demonstrated based on adopting FNN model for feature selection in classification problems. But in the end, a generalization framework is discussed in order to give insights into the usage in regression problems as well as expressing how other function approximate models can be deployed.

"  Real-time semantic segmentation on high-resolution videos is challenging due to the strict requirements of speed. Recent approaches have utilized the inter-frame continuity to reduce redundant computation by warping the feature maps across adjacent frames, greatly speeding up the inference phase. However, their accuracy drops significantly owing to the imprecise motion estimation and error accumulation. In this paper, we propose to introduce a simple and effective correction stage right after the warping stage to form a framework named Tamed Warping Network (TWNet), aiming to improve the accuracy and robustness of warping-based models. The experimental results on the Cityscapes dataset show that with the correction, the accuracy (mIoU) significantly increases from 67.3% to 71.6%, and the speed edges down from 65.5 FPS to 61.8 FPS. For non-rigid categories such as ""human"" and ""object"", the improvements of IoU are even higher than 18 percentage points.

"  We present a calibration of the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) on the HST/ACS F814W system. We use archival HST observations to derive blending corrections and photometric transformations for two ground-based wide-area imaging surveys of the Magellanic Clouds. We show that these surveys are biased bright by up to ~0.1 mag in the optical due to blending, and that the bias is a function of local stellar density. We correct the LMC TRGB magnitudes from Jang & Lee (2017) and use the geometric distance from Pietrzynski et al. (2019) to obtain an absolute TRGB magnitude of M_F814W=-3.97+/-0.046 mag. Applying this calibration to the TRGB magnitudes from Freedman et al. (2019) in SN Ia hosts yields a value for the Hubble constant of H_0=72.4+/-2.0 km/s/Mpc for their TRGB+SNe Ia distance ladder. The difference in the TRGB calibration and the value of H_0 derived here and by Freedman et al. (2019) primarily results from their overestimate of the LMC extinction, caused by inconsistencies in their different sources of TRGB photometry for the Magellanic Clouds. Using the same source of photometry (OGLE) for both Clouds and applying the aforementioned corrections yields a value for the LMC I-band TRGB extinction that is lower by 0.06 mag, consistent with independent OGLE reddening maps used by us and by Jang & Lee (2017) to calibrate TRGB and determine H_0.

"  We derive a transformation from the usual ADM metric-extrinsic curvature variables on the phase space of Schwarzschild black holes, to new canonical variables which have the interpretation of Kruskal coordinates. We explicitly show that this transformation is non-singular, even at the horizon. The constraints of the theory simplify in terms of the new canonical variables and are equivalent to the vanishing of the canonical momenta. Our work is based on earlier seminal work by Kuchar in which he reconstructed curvature coordinates and a mass function from spherically symmetric canonical data. The key feature in our construction of a nonsingular canonical transformation to Kruskal variables, is the scaling of the curvature coordinate variables by the mass function rather than by the mass at left spatial infinity.

"  Understanding mechanisms capable of altering the vacuum energy is currently of interest in field theories and cosmology. We consider an interacting scalar field and show that the vacuum energy naturally takes any value between its maximum and zero because interaction affects the number of operating field modes, the assertion that involves no assumptions or postulates. The mechanism is similar to the recently discussed temperature evolution of collective modes in liquids. The cosmological implication concerns the evolution of scalar field $\phi$ during the inflation of the Universe. $\phi$ starts with all field modes operating and maximal vacuum energy in the early inflation-dominated epoch. As a result of inflation, $\phi$ undergoes a dynamical crossover and arrives in the state with one long-wavelength longitudinal mode and small positive vacuum energy predicted to be asymptotically decreasing to zero in the late epoch. Accordingly, we predict that the currently observed cosmological constant will decrease in the future, and comment on the possibility of a cyclic Universe.

This approach enables efficient computation of quantile functions that arise in chance constraints. We are motivated by multi-vehicle planning problems in LTI systems, with norm-based collision avoidance constraints and polytopic feasibility constraints. These constraints can be posed as reverse-convex and convex chance constraints, respectively, that are affine in the control and in the disturbance. We show that for constraints of this form, piecewise affine approximations of the quantile function can be embedded in a difference-of-convex program that enables use of conic solvers. We demonstrate our method on multi-satellite coordination with Gaussian and Cauchy disturbances, and provide a comparison with particle control.

"  L1 guidance logic is one of the most widely used path following controllers for small fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), primarily due to its simplicity (low-cost implementation on embedded on-board processors, e.g. micro-controllers) and ability to track both circles and lines, which make up the vast majority of a typical fixed-wing vehicle's flight plan. The logic was later extended for speed independent dynamic similarity with an adaptive L1 distance, a formulation currently used on common open-source autopilot platforms. Two primary drawbacks remain, specific to small, slow flying fixed-wing UAVs; namely, 1) the combination of low operator defined gains and high ground speeds may violate the bounds of the algorithms convergence region for the case of loiter circles with small radii and 2) L1 logic breaks down when wind speeds exceed the vehicle's airspeed, another common predicament for small, slow-flying UAVs. This brief presents simple extensions to this extensively field tested algorithm, allowing legacy operators to keep existing controller tunings while taking advantage of the enhanced performance and safety features developed within.

"  In our previous work, the connected and leading disconnected hadronic light-by-light contributions to the muon anomalous magnetic moment (g - 2) have been computed using lattice QCD ensembles corresponding to physical pion mass generated by the RBC/UKQCD collaboration. However, the calculation is expected to suffer from a significant finite volume error that scales like $1/L^2$ where $L$ is the spatial size of the lattice. In this paper, we demonstrate that this problem is cured by treating the muon and photons in infinite volume, continuum QED, resulting in a weighting function that is pre-computed and saved with affordable cost and sufficient accuracy. We present numerical results for the case when the quark loop is replaced by a muon loop, finding the expected exponential approach to the infinite volume limit and consistency with the known analytic result.

"  The rotation axis of the Sun is misaligned from the mean angular momentum plane of the Solar system by about 6 degrees. This obliquity significantly exceeds the ~1-2 degree distribution of inclinations among the planetary orbits and therefore requires a physical explanation. In concert, Sun-like stars are known to spin down by an order of magnitude throughout their lifetimes. This spin-down is driven by the stellar wind, which carries angular momentum from the star. If the mean angular momentum axis of the stellar wind deviates from that of the stellar spin axis, it will lead to a component of the spin-down torque that acts to tilt the star. Here, we show that Solar-like tilts of 6 degrees naturally arise during the first 10-100 Myr after planet formation as a result of stellar winds that deviate by about 10 degrees from the star's spin axis. These results apply to the idealized case of a dipolar field, mildly inclined to the spin axis. Time-variability in the misalignment between the magnetic and spin poles is modeled as stochastic fluctuations, autocorrelated over timescales comparable to the primordial spin-down time of several million years. In addition to wind direction, time-variability in mass-loss rate and magnetic topology over the stellar lifetime may alternatively generate obliquity. We hypothesize that the gaseous environments of young, open clusters may provide forcing over sufficient timescales to tilt the astrospheres of young stars, exciting modest obliquities. The more extreme, retrograde stellar obliquities of extrasolar planetary systems likely arise through separate mechanisms. ",Stellar winds as a mechanism to tilt the spin axes of Sun-like stars
"  We present a theory for slicing probabilistic imperative programs -- containing random assignments, and ``observe'' statements (for conditioning) -- represented as probabilistic control-flow graphs (pCFGs) whose nodes modify probability distributions.   We show that such a representation allows direct adaptation of standard machinery such as data and control dependence, postdominators, relevant variables, etc to the probabilistic setting. We separate the specification of slicing from its implementation: first we develop syntactic conditions that a slice must satisfy; next we prove that any such slice is semantically correct; finally we give an algorithm to compute the least slice. To generate smaller slices, we may in addition take advantage of knowledge that certain loops will terminate (almost) always.   A key feature of our syntactic conditions is that they involve two disjoint slices such that the variables of one slice are probabilistically independent of the variables of the other. This leads directly to a proof of correctness of probabilistic slicing. In a companion article we show adequacy of the semantics of pCFGs with respect to the standard semantics of structured probabilistic programs.

"  Super-bubbles are shells in the interstellar medium produced by the simultaneous explosions of many supernova remnants. The solutions of the mathematical diffusion and of the Fourier expansion in 1D, 2D and 3D were deduced in order to describe the diffusion of nucleons from such structures. The mean number of visits in the the case of the Levy flights in 1D was computed with a Monte Carlo simulation. The diffusion of cosmic rays has its physical explanation in the relativistic Larmor gyro-radius which is energy dependent. The mathematical solution of the diffusion equation in 1D with variable diffusion coefficient was computed. Variable diffusion coefficient means magnetic field variable with the altitude from the Galactic plane. The analytical solutions allow us to calibrate the code that describes the Monte Carlo diffusion.   The maximum energy that can be extracted from the super-bubbles is deduced. The concentration of cosmic rays is a function of the distance from the nearest super-bubble and the selected energy. The interaction of the cosmic rays on the target material allows us to trace the theoretical map of the diffuse Galactic continuum gamma-rays. The streaming of the cosmic rays from the Gould Belts that contains the sun at it's internal was described by a Monte Carlo simulation. Nine new formulas are derived.

"  In two important papers from 1960 Graham Higman introduced the notion of PORC functions, and he proved that for any given positive integer $n$ the number of $p$-class two groups of order $p^n$ is a PORC function of $p$. A key result in his proof of this theorem is the following: ""The number of ways of choosing a finite number of elements from the finite field of order $q^n$ subject to a finite number of monomial equations and inequalities between them and their conjugates over GF($q$), considered as a function of $q$, is PORC.""

Our proof is constructive, and gives an algorithms for computing the relevant PORC functions. ",Choosing elements from finite fields
"  Birkhoff's theorem is a classic result that characterizes locally spherically symmetric solutions of the Einstein equations. In this paper, we illustrate the consequences of its local nature for the cases of vacuum and positive cosmological constant. We construct several examples of initial data for spherically symmetric spacetimes on Cauchy surfaces of different topology than that of the maximal analytic extension of Schwarzschild and Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetimes. The spacetimes formed from the evolution of these initial data sets also have very different physical properties; in particular they need not contain a static region or be asymptotically flat or asymptotically de Sitter. We also present locally spherically symmetric initial data sets for de Sitter spacetimes that are not covered by the maximal analytic extension of de Sitter spacetime itself. Finally we illustrate the utility of Birkhoff's theorem in identifying the spacetimes associated with two spherically symmetric initial data sets; one proven to exist but not explicitly exhibited and one which has negative ADM mass.

"  The joint eigenvalue distributions of random-matrix ensembles are derived by applying the principle maximum entropy to the Renyi, Abe and Kaniadakis entropies. While the Renyi entropy produces essentially the same matrix-element distributions as the previously obtained expression by using the Tsallis entropy, and the Abe entropy does not lead to a closed form expression, the Kaniadakis entropy leads to a new generalized form of the Wigner surmise that describes a transition of the spacing distribution from chaos to order. This expression is compared with the corresponding expression obtained by assuming Tsallis' entropy as well as the results of a previous numerical experiment.

"  Task selection (picking an appropriate labeling task) and worker selection (assigning the labeling task to a suitable worker) are two major challenges in task assignment for crowdsourcing. Recently, worker selection has been successfully addressed by the bandit-based task assignment (BBTA) method, while task selection has not been thoroughly investigated yet. In this paper, we experimentally compare several task selection strategies borrowed from active learning literature, and show that the least confidence strategy significantly improves the performance of task assignment in crowdsourcing.

"  Let $q\geq 2$ be an integer, and $\Bbb F_q^d$, $d\geq 1$, be the vector space over the cyclic space $\Bbb F_q$. The purpose of this paper is two-fold. First, we obtain sufficient conditions on $E \subset \Bbb F_q^d$ such that the inverse Fourier transform of $1_E$ generates a tight wavelet frame in $L^2(\Bbb F_q^d)$. We call these sets (tight) wavelet frame sets. The conditions are given in terms of multiplicative and translational tilings, which is analogous with Theorem 1.1 ([20]) by Wang in the setting of finite fields. In the second part of the paper, we exhibit a constructive method for obtaining tight wavelet frame sets in $\Bbb F_q^d$, $d\geq 2$, $q$ an odd prime and $q\equiv 3$ (mod 4).

Although the authors have attempted to keep the presentation self-contained as much as possible, some previous exposure to the language of differential geometry may be helpful. In this sense the work is aimed to late undergraduate or beginners graduate students interested in mathematical physics. To illustrate the development, we graphically present the eleven coordinate systems in which the Laplace operator is separable. We detail the development of the basis and the connection for the cylindrical and paraboloidal coordinate systems. We also present in [1] codes both in Maxima and Maple for the spherical orthonormal basis, which serves as a working model for calculations in other situations of interest. Also in [1] the codes to obtain the coordinate surfaces are given. ",The divergence and curl in arbitrary basis
"  This paper introduces a two-phase deep feature engineering framework for efficient learning of semantics enhanced joint embedding, which clearly separates the deep feature engineering in data preprocessing from training the text-image joint embedding model. We use the Recipe1M dataset for the technical description and empirical validation. In preprocessing, we perform deep feature engineering by combining deep feature engineering with semantic context features derived from raw text-image input data. We leverage LSTM to identify key terms, deep NLP models from the BERT family, TextRank, or TF-IDF to produce ranking scores for key terms before generating the vector representation for each key term by using word2vec. We leverage wideResNet50 and word2vec to extract and encode the image category semantics of food images to help semantic alignment of the learned recipe and image embeddings in the joint latent space. In joint embedding learning, we perform deep feature engineering by optimizing the batch-hard triplet loss function with soft-margin and double negative sampling, taking into account also the category-based alignment loss and discriminator-based alignment loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our SEJE approach with deep feature engineering significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.

"  We use Lattice-Boltzmann and analytical calculations to investigate transient hydrodynamic finite size effects induced by the use of periodic boundary conditions in simulations at the molecular, mesoscopic or continuum levels of description. We analyze the transient response to a local perturbation in the fluid and obtain via linear response theory the local velocity correlation function. This new approach is validated by comparing the finite size effects on the steady-state velocity with the known results for the diffusion coefficient. We next investigate the full time-dependence of the local velocity auto-correlation function. We find at long times a cross-over between the expected $t^{-3/2}$ hydrodynamic tail and an oscillatory exponential decay, and study the scaling with the system size of the cross-over time, exponential rate and amplitude, and oscillation frequency. We interpret these results from the analytic solution of the compressible Navier-Stokes equation for the slowest modes, which are set by the system size. The present work not only provides a comprehensive analysis of hydrodynamic finite size effects in bulk fluids, but also establishes the Lattice-Boltzmann method as a suitable tool to investigate such effects in general.

"  We discuss the nature of the velocity dispersion vs. size relation for molecular clouds. In particular, we add to previous observational results showing that the velocity dispersions in molecular clouds and cores are not purely functions of spatial scale but involve surface gas densities as well. We emphasize that hydrodynamic turbulence is required to produce the first condensations in the progenitor medium. However, as the cloud is forming, it also becomes bound, and gravitational accelerations dominate the motions. Energy conservation in this case implies $|E_g| \sim E_k$, in agreement with observational data, and providing an interpretation for two recent observational results: the scatter in the $\delta v-R$ plane, and the dependence of the velocity dispersion on the surface density ${\delta v^2/ R} \propto \Sigma$. We argue that the observational data are consistent with molecular clouds in a state of hierarchical gravitational collapse, i.e., developing local centers of collapse throughout the whole cloud while the cloud itself is collapsing, and making equilibrium unnecessary at all stages prior to the formation of actual stars. Finally, we discuss how this mechanism need not be in conflict with the observed star formation rate. ",Gravity or Turbulence? The velocity dispersion-size relation
"  The one-dimensional Holstein-Hubbard model with two electrons of opposite spin is studied using an extension of a recently developed quantum Monte Carlo method, and a very simple yet rewarding variational approach, both based on a canonically transformed Hamiltonian. The quantum Monte Carlo method yields very accurate results in the regime of small but finite phonon frequencies, characteristic of many strongly correlated materials such as, e.g., the cuprates and the manganites. The influence of electron-electron repulsion, phonon frequency and temperature on the bipolaron state is investigated. Thermal dissociation of the intersite bipolaron is observed at high temperatures, and its relation to an existing theory of the manganites is discussed.

"  The reduced dynamics for dark and bright soliton chains in the one-dimensional nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation is used to study the behavior of collective compression waves. For appropriate conditions, the reduced dynamics derived from perturbation and variational techniques allows to describe a chain of dark or bright solitons as a chain of effective masses connected by nonlinear springs taking the form of a Toda lattice model on the soliton's positions. In turn, the Toda lattice possesses exact solitary travelling compression wave solutions corresponding to travelling compression waves in the original soliton chain. We coin the term hypersoliton to describe such solitary waves riding on a chain of solitons. We corroborate our analytical results with direct numerical simulations of the nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation. It is observed that in the case of dark soliton chains, the formulated reduction dynamics provides an accurate description for the robust evolution of travelling compression waves. In contrast, bright soliton chains do not have such stable propagating solutions due to the desynchronization of the mutual phases between consecutive solitons during evolution. Finally, as an application to Bose-Einstein condensates trapped in a standard external harmonic trapping potential, we study the case of finite dark soliton chain confined at the center of the trap. We find that when the central chain is hit by a dark soliton initiated at the edge of the external trap, the energy is transferred through the chain as a hypersoliton. When the hypersoliton reaches the end of the central chain, a dark soliton is ejected away from the center of the trap and, as it returns from its excursion up the trap, hits the central chain producing again a hypersoliton. This periodic evolution is the equivalent of the classical Newton's cradle. ",Solitons Riding on Solitons: Hypersolitons and the Quantum Newton's   Cradle

All four bright images of the quasar, as well as resolved X-ray emission originating from the lensing cluster, are clearly detected. The emission from the lensing cluster extends out to approximately 1.5 arcmin. We measure the bolometric X-ray luminosity and temperature of the lensing cluster to be 4.7e44 erg s^-1 and 6.4 keV, consistent with the luminosity-temperature relation for distant clusters. The mass estimated from the X-ray observation shows excellent agreement with the mass derived from gravitational lensing. The X-ray flux ratios of the quasar images differ markedly from the optical flux ratios, and the combined X-ray spectrum of the images possesses an unusually strong Fe Kalpha emission line, both of which are indicative of microlensing.

"  We consider the exchange statistics of vortices, each of which traps an odd number ($N$) of Majorana fermions. We assume that the fermions in a vortex transform in the vector representation of the SO(N) group. Exchange of two vortices turns out to be non-Abelian, and the corresponding operator is further decomposed into two parts: a part that is essentially equivalent to the exchange operator of vortices having a single Majorana fermion in each vortex, and a part representing the Coxeter group. Similar decomposition was already found in the case with N=3, and the result shown here is a generalization to the case with an arbitrary odd $N$. We can obtain the matrix representation of the exchange operators in the Hilbert space that is constructed by using Dirac fermions non-locally defined by Majorana fermions trapped in separated vortices. We also show that the decomposition of the exchange operator implies tensor product structure in its matrix representation. ",Non-Abelian statistics of vortices with multiple Majorana fermions
"  It is shown that a self-dual neutral Einstein four-manifold of Petrov type III, admitting a two-dimensional null parallel distribution compatible with the orientation, cannot be compact or locally homogeneous, and its maximum possible degree of mobility is 3. Diaz-Ramos, Garcia-Rio and Vazquez-Lorenzo found a general coordinate form of such manifolds. The present paper also provides a modified version of that coordinate form, valid in a suitably defined generic case and, in a sense, ""more canonical"" than the usual formulation. Moreover, the local-isometry types of manifolds as above having the degree of mobility equal to 3 are classified. Further results consist in explicit descriptions, first, of the kernel and image of the Killing operator for any torsionfree surface connection with everywhere-nonzero, skew-symmetric Ricci tensor, and, secondly, of a moduli curve for surface connections with the properties just mentioned that are, in addition, locally homogeneous. Finally, hyperbolic plane geometry is used to exhibit examples of codimension-two foliations on compact manifolds of dimensions greater than 2 admitting a transversal torsionfree connection, the Ricci tensor of which is skew-symmetric and nonzero everywhere. No such connection exists on any closed surface, so that there are no analogous examples in dimension 2.

Two simple classical models for radiation from individual emitters are compared, one based on sines with random phasejumps, another based on pulse trains. The sum signal is calculated for a varying number of emitters. The focus lies on the final signal's statistical features quantified by means of the temporal coherence function and the temporal coherence length. We show how these features might be used to experimentally differentiate between the models. We also point to ambiguities in the definition of the temporal coherence length.

"  Many imaging tasks require global information about all pixels in an image. Conventional bottom-up classification networks globalize information by decreasing resolution; features are pooled and downsampled into a single output. But for semantic segmentation and object detection tasks, a network must provide higher-resolution pixel-level outputs. To globalize information while preserving resolution, many researchers propose the inclusion of sophisticated auxiliary blocks, but these come at the cost of a considerable increase in network size and computational cost. This paper proposes stacked u-nets (SUNets), which iteratively combine features from different resolution scales while maintaining resolution. SUNets leverage the information globalization power of u-nets in a deeper network architectures that is capable of handling the complexity of natural images. SUNets perform extremely well on semantic segmentation tasks using a small number of parameters. ",Stacked U-Nets: A No-Frills Approach to Natural Image Segmentation
"  Soil moisture (SM) is a key state variable of the hydrological cycle, needed to monitor the effects of a changing climate on natural resources. Soil moisture is highly variable in space and time, presenting seasonalities, anomalies and long-term trends, but also, and important nonlinear behaviours.

We use global SM estimates acquired during the period 2010-2017 by ESA's SMOS mission. Our approach unveils both time and space modes, trends and periodicities unlike standard PCA decompositions. Results show the distribution of the total SM variance among its different components, and indicate the dominant modes of temporal variability in surface soil moisture for different regions.

"  Rationalizing which parts of a molecule drive the predictions of a molecular graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) can be difficult. To help, we propose two simple regularization techniques to apply during the training of GCNNs: Batch Representation Orthonormalization (BRO) and Gini regularization. BRO, inspired by molecular orbital theory, encourages graph convolution operations to generate orthonormal node embeddings. Gini regularization is applied to the weights of the output layer and constrains the number of dimensions the model can use to make predictions. We show that Gini and BRO regularization can improve the accuracy of state-of-the-art GCNN attribution methods on artificial benchmark datasets. In a real-world setting, we demonstrate that medicinal chemists significantly prefer explanations extracted from regularized models. While we only study these regularizers in the context of GCNNs, both can be applied to other types of neural networks ",Improving Molecular Graph Neural Network Explainability with   Orthonormalization and Induced Sparsity

"  This paper presents a new method, called FlexiCurve, for photo enhancement. Unlike most existing methods that perform image-to-image mapping, which requires expensive pixel-wise reconstruction, FlexiCurve takes an input image and estimates global curves to adjust the image. The adjustment curves are specially designed for performing piecewise mapping, taking nonlinear adjustment and differentiability into account. To cope with challenging and diverse illumination properties in real-world images, FlexiCurve is formulated as a multi-task framework to produce diverse estimations and the associated confidence maps. These estimations are adaptively fused to improve local enhancements of different regions. Thanks to the image-to-curve formulation, for an image with a size of 512*512*3, FlexiCurve only needs a lightweight network (150K trainable parameters) and it has a fast inference speed (83FPS on a single NVIDIA 2080Ti GPU). The proposed method improves efficiency without compromising the enhancement quality and losing details in the original image. The method is also appealing as it is not limited to paired training data, thus it can flexibly learn rich enhancement styles from unpaired data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on photo enhancement quantitively and qualitatively.

Finally, it is concluded that no single low cost RFID protocol fully meets the requirement of the given assessments. While a protocol satisfies one or two assessments, it fails to fully meet the requirement of the third assessment.

"  This work proposes to use passive acoustic perception as an additional sensing modality for intelligent vehicles. We demonstrate that approaching vehicles behind blind corners can be detected by sound before such vehicles enter in line-of-sight. We have equipped a research vehicle with a roof-mounted microphone array, and show on data collected with this sensor setup that wall reflections provide information on the presence and direction of occluded approaching vehicles. A novel method is presented to classify if and from what direction a vehicle is approaching before it is visible, using as input Direction-of-Arrival features that can be efficiently computed from the streaming microphone array data. Since the local geometry around the ego-vehicle affects the perceived patterns, we systematically study several environment types, and investigate generalization across these environments. With a static ego-vehicle, an accuracy of 0.92 is achieved on the hidden vehicle classification task. Compared to a state-of-the-art visual detector, Faster R-CNN, our pipeline achieves the same accuracy more than one second ahead, providing crucial reaction time for the situations we study. While the ego-vehicle is driving, we demonstrate positive results on acoustic detection, still achieving an accuracy of 0.84 within one environment type. We further study failure cases across environments to identify future research directions. ",Hearing What You Cannot See: Acoustic Vehicle Detection Around Corners
"  We employ low-frequency Raman spectroscopy to study the nearly commensurate (NC) to commensurate (C) charge density wave (CDW) transition in 1T-TaS2 ultrathin flakes protected from oxidation. We identify new modes originating from C phase CDW phonons that are distinct from those seen in bulk 1T-TaS2. We attribute these to CDW modes from the surface layers. By monitoring individual modes with temperature, we find that surfaces undergo a separate, low-hysteresis NC-C phase transition that is decoupled from the transition in the bulk layers. This indicates the activation of a secondary phase nucleation process in the limit of weak interlayer interaction, which can be understood from energy considerations.

Equivalently, the corresponding ""fluid particle motion"" is integrable. Applying this result to the Camassa-Holm equation, we express the drift of particles in terms of parameters labelling periodic peakons and exhibit orbital bifurcations: points in parameter space where the drift velocity varies discontinuously, reflecting a sudden change in the topology of Virasoro orbits.

"  Continuous goodness-of-fit testing is a classical problem in statistics. Despite having low power for detecting deviations at the tail of a distribution, the most popular test is based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic. While similar variance-weighted statistics, such as Anderson-Darling and the Higher Criticism statistic give more weight to tail deviations, as shown in various works, they still mishandle the extreme tails.   As a viable alternative, in this paper we study some of the statistical properties of the exact $M_n$ statistics of Berk and Jones. We derive the asymptotic null distributions of $M_n, M_n^+, M_n^-$, and further prove their consistency as well as asymptotic optimality for a wide range of rare-weak mixture models. Additionally, we present a new computationally efficient method to calculate $p$-values for any supremum-based one-sided statistic, including the one-sided $M_n^+,M_n^-$ and $R_n^+,R_n^-$ statistics of Berk and Jones and the Higher Criticism statistic.

"  We present an analysis of X-ray and ultra-violet data of the dwarf nova VW Hyi that were obtained with XMM-Newton during the quiescent state. The X-ray spectrum indicates the presence of an optically thin plasma in the boundary layer that cools as it settles onto the white dwarf. The plasma has a continuous temperature distribution that is well described by a power-law or a cooling flow model with a maximum temperature of 6-8 keV. We estimate from the X-ray spectrum a boundary layer luminosity of 8*10^30 erg/s, which is only 20 per cent of the disk luminosity. The rate of accretion onto the white dwarf is 5*10^-12 solar masses per year, about half of the rate in the disk. From the high-resolution X-ray spectra, we estimate that the X-ray emitting part of the boundary layer is rotating with a velocity of 540 km/s, which is close the rotation velocity of the white dwarf but significantly smaller than the Keplerian velocity. We detect a 60-s quasi-periodic oscillation of the X-ray flux that is likely due to the rotation of the boundary layer. The X-ray and the ultra-violet flux show strong variability on a time scale of ~1500 s. We find that the variability in the two bands is correlated and that the X-ray fluctuations are delayed by ~100 s. The correlation indicates that the variable ultra-violet flux is emitted near the transition region between the disk and the boundary layer and that accretion rate fluctuations in this region are propagated to the X-ray emitting part of the boundary layer within ~100 s. An orbital modulation of the X-ray flux suggests that the inner accretion disk is tilted with respect to the orbital plane. The elemental abundances in the boundary layer are close to their solar values. ",X-ray and UV observations of the dwarf nova VW Hyi in quiescence

  We argue that String Theory and Loop Quantum Gravity can be thought of as describing different regimes of a single unified theory of quantum gravity. LQG can be thought of as providing the pre-geometric exoskeleton out of which macroscopic geometry emerges and String Theory then becomes the \emph{effective} theory which describes the dynamics of that exoskeleton. The core of the argument rests on the claim that the Nambu-Goto action of String Theory can be viewed as the expectation value of the LQG area operator evaluated on the string worldsheet. A concrete result is that the string tension of String Theory and the Barbero-Immirzi parameter of LQG turn out to be proportional to each other. ,Connecting Loop Quantum Gravity and String Theory via Quantum Geometry

We consider a spectroscopically selected sample of 226 galaxies at z$>$1.5 of which 135 are in the redshift range 1.5$<z<3$. Less than 1/4 of galaxies considered here are detected at 24 microns. They primarily have red UV slopes but consitute about only 20 percent of the red galaxies in this sample indicating that the red UV colors of the majority of objects is due to an evolved stellar population. Although 24 micron sources are sparse in number, their combined energy output in the 1.5$<z<3$ range exceeds the combined UV luminosity of the sample by a factor of about 30. We also find that AGN, identified by their X-ray to infrared luminosity ratios, account for less than 10 percent of the sources considered and contribute less than 30 percent of the total budget in this redshift range. The infrared luminous galaxies which are increasingly being found at high-z appear to dominate the global energetics of the Universe out to z~3 as has previously been predicted.

"  Obstructive sleep Apnea (OSA) is a form of sleep disordered breathing characterized by frequent episodes of upper airway collapse during sleep. Pediatric OSA occurs in 1-5% of children and can related to other serious health conditions such as high blood pressure, behavioral issues, or altered growth. OSA is often diagnosed by studying the patient's sleep cycle, the pattern with which they progress through various sleep states such as wakefulness, rapid eye-movement, and non-rapid eye-movement. The sleep state data is obtained using an overnight polysomnography test that the patient undergoes at a hospital or sleep clinic, where a technician manually labels each 30 second time interval, also called an ""epoch"", with the current sleep state. This process is laborious and prone to human error. We seek an automatic method of classifying the sleep state, as well as a method to analyze the sleep cycles. This article is a pilot study in sleep state classification using two approaches: first, we'll use methods from the field of topological data analysis to classify the sleep state and second, we'll model sleep states as a Markov chain and visually analyze the sleep patterns. In the future, we will continue to build on this work to improve our methods. ",Classifying sleep states using persistent homology and Markov chain: a   Pilot Study

"  We investigate whether black holes can be defined without using event horizons. In particular we focus on the thermodynamic properties of event horizons and the alternative, locally defined horizons. We discuss the assumptions and limitations of the proofs of the zeroth, first and second laws of black hole mechanics for both event horizons and trapping horizons. This leads to the possibility that black holes may be more usefully defined in terms of trapping horizons. We also show how Hawking radiation can also be seen to arise from trapping horizons and discuss which horizon area should be associated with the gravitational entropy.

"  Let $X$ and $X'$ be affine algebraic varieties over a field $\mathbb{k}$. The celebrated Zariski Cancellation Problem asks as to when the existence of an isomorphism $X\times\mathbb{A}^n\cong X'\times\mathbb{A}^n$ implies $X\cong X'$. In Part I of this paper (arXiv:1610.01805) we provided a criterion for cancellation in the case where $X$ is a normal affine surface admitting an $\mathbb{A}^1$-fibration $X\to B$ over a smooth affine curve $B$. If $X$ does not admit such an $\mathbb{A}^1$-fibration then the cancellation by the affine line is known to hold for $X$ by a result of Bandman and Makar-Limanov. In the present Part II we classify all pairs $(X,X')$ of smooth affine surfaces $\mathbb{A}^1$-fibered over $B$ with only reduced fibers whose cylinders $X\times\mathbb{A}^1$, $X'\times\mathbb{A}^1$ are isomorphic over $B$. Our criterion of isomorphism of cylinders over $B$ is expressed in terms of linear equivalence of certain divisors on the Danielewski-Fieseler quotient of $X$ over $B$. Under a mild restriction we construct a coarse moduli of such surfaces. ",Cancellation for surfaces revisited. II

"  We use the terms $\infty$-categories and $\infty$-functors to mean the objects and morphisms in an $\infty$-cosmos: a simplicially enriched category satisfying a few axioms, reminiscent of an enriched category of fibrant objects. Quasi-categories, Segal categories, complete Segal spaces, marked simplicial sets, iterated complete Segal spaces, $\theta_n$-spaces, and fibered versions of each of these are all $\infty$-categories in this sense. Previous work in this series shows that the basic category theory of $\infty$-categories and $\infty$-functors can be developed only in reference to the axioms of an $\infty$-cosmos; indeed, most of the work is internal to the homotopy 2-category, a strict 2-category of $\infty$-categories, $\infty$-functors, and natural transformations. In the $\infty$-cosmos of quasi-categories, we recapture precisely the same category theory developed by Joyal and Lurie, although our definitions are 2-categorical in natural, making no use of the combinatorial details that differentiate each model.   In this paper, we introduce cartesian fibrations, a certain class of $\infty$-functors, and their groupoidal variants. Cartesian fibrations form a cornerstone in the abstract treatment of ""category-like"" structures a la Street and play an important role in Lurie's work on quasi-categories. After setting up their basic theory, we state and prove the Yoneda lemma, which has the form of an equivalence between the quasi-category of maps out of a representable fibration and the quasi-category underlying the fiber over its representing element. A companion paper will apply these results to establish a calculus of modules between $\infty$-categories, which will be used to define and study pointwise Kan extensions along $\infty$-functors.

"  We reconsider the model of neutrino production during the 'bright phase', first suggested in 1977, in the light of modern understanding of the role of Pop III stars and acceleration of particles in supernova shocks. We concentrate on the production of cosmogenic UHE neutrinos in supernova explosions that accompany the death of Pop III stars. Accelerated protons produce neutrinos in collisions with CMB photons. We deliberately use simplified assumptions which make our results transparent. Pop III stars are assumed to be responsible for the reionization of the universe as observed by WMAP. Since the evolution of Pop III stars is much faster than the Hubble rate, we consider the burst of UHE proton production to occur at fixed redshift (z_b=10-20). We discuss the formation of collisionless shocks and particle acceleration in the early universe. The composition of accelerated particles is expected to be proton dominated. A simple calculation is presented to illustrate the fact that the diffuse neutrinos flux from the bright phase burst is concentrated in a relatively narrow range around $7.5 \times 10^{15}(20/z_b)^2$ eV. The $\nu_\mu$ flux may be detectable by IceCube without violating the cascade upper limit and the expected energetics of SNe associated with Pop III stars. A possible signature of the neutrino production from Pop III stars may be the detection of resonant neutrino events. For the burst at $z_b=20$ and $\bar{\nu}_e$-flux at the cascade upper limit, the number of resonant events in IceCube may be as high as 10 events in 5 years of observations. These events have equal energies, $E=6.3\times 10^{15}$ eV, in the form of e-m cascades. Given the large uncertainties in the existing predictions of UHE cosmogenic neutrino fluxes, we argue that neutrinos from the first stars might become one of the most reliable hopes for UHE neutrino astronomy.

"  We present a new investigation of the dependence of H2O maser detection rates and properties on the mid-IR AGN luminosity, L_AGN, and the obscuring column density, N_H, based on mid-IR and hard X-ray photometry. Based on spectral energy distribution fitting that allows for decomposition of the black hole accretion and star-formation components in the mid-infrared, we show that the megamaser (disk maser) detection rate increases sharply for galaxies with 12 micron AGN luminosity L^{AGN}_{12 micron} greater than 10^42 erg/s, from ~<3%(~<2%) to ~12%(~5%). By using the ratio of the observed X-ray to mid-IR AGN luminosity as an indicator of N_H, we also find that the megamaser (disk maser) detection rates are boosted to 15%(7%) and 20%(9%) for galaxies with N_H >= 10^23 cm^{-2} and N_H >= 10^{24} cm^{-2}, respectively. Combining these column density cuts with a constraint for high L^{AGN}_{12 micron} (>=10^42 erg/s) predicts further increases in the megamaser (disk maser) detection rates to 19%(8%) and 27%(14%), revealing unprecedented potential boosts of the megamaser and disk maser detection rates by a factor of 7-15 relative to the current rates, depending on the chosen sample selection criteria. A noteworthy aspect of these new predictions is that the completeness rates are only compromised mildly, with the rates remaining at the level of ~95%(~50%) for sources with N_H >= 10^{23} cm^{-2} (N_H >= 10^24 cm^-2). Applying these selection methods to the current X-ray AGN surveys predicts the detection of >~15 new megamaser disks.

"  Fine-tuning a network which has been trained on a large dataset is an alternative to full training in order to overcome the problem of scarce and expensive data in medical applications. While the shallow layers of the network are usually kept unchanged, deeper layers are modified according to the new dataset. This approach may not work for ultrasound images due to their drastically different appearance. In this study, we investigated the effect of fine-tuning different layers of a U-Net which was trained on segmentation of natural images in breast ultrasound image segmentation. Tuning the contracting part and fixing the expanding part resulted in substantially better results compared to fixing the contracting part and tuning the expanding part. Furthermore, we showed that starting to fine-tune the U-Net from the shallow layers and gradually including more layers will lead to a better performance compared to fine-tuning the network from the deep layers moving back to shallow layers. We did not observe the same results on segmentation of X-ray images, which have different salient features compared to ultrasound, it may therefore be more appropriate to fine-tune the shallow layers rather than deep layers. Shallow layers learn lower level features (including speckle pattern, and probably the noise and artifact properties) which are critical in automatic segmentation in this modality.

"  According to strong demands for rapid and reliable software delivery, co-existing database schema versions with multiple application versions are reality to contribute them. Current database management systems do not support co-existing schema versions in one database. Although a design of co-existing schema based on updatable view tables was previously proposed, its flexibility is limited due to pre-defined several restrictions to achieve data synchronization among schemas and handling independent unsynchronized data in each schema. In this preliminary report, we present a new approach for co-existing schemas based on bidirectional transformation. We explain the required properties to realize co-existing schemas, bidirectionality and totality. We show that the co-existing schemas can be implemented systematically by applying putback-based bidirectional transformation to satisfy both the bidirectionality and the totality. While the bidirectionality can be satisfied by applying bidirectional transformation, to satisfy the totality, extra functions need to be introduced. How to derive these extra functions is presented.

"  In source memory studies, a decision-maker is concerned with identifying the context in which a given episodic experience occurred. A common paradigm for studying source memory is the `three-list' experimental paradigm, where a subject studies three lists of words and is later asked whether a given word appeared on one or more of the studied lists. Surprisingly, the sum total of the acceptance probabilities generated by asking for the source of a word separately for each list (`list 1?', `list 2?', `list 3?') exceeds the acceptance probability generated by asking whether that word occurred on the union of the lists (`list 1 or 2 or 3?'). The episodic memory for a given word therefore appears over distributed on the disjoint contexts of the lists. A quantum episodic memory model [QEM] was proposed by Brainerd, Wang and Reyna (2013) to explain this type of result. In this paper, we apply a Hamiltonian dynamical extension of QEM for over distribution of source memory. The Hamiltonian operators are simultaneously driven by parameters for re-allocation of gist-based and verbatim-based acceptance support as subjects are exposed to the cue word in the first temporal stage, and are attenuated for description-dependence by the querying probe in the second temporal stage. Overall, the model predicts well the choice proportions in both separate list and union list queries and the over distribution effect, suggesting that a Hamiltonian dynamics for QEM can provide a good account of the acceptance processes involved in episodic memory tasks.

"  The detection of two similar periodicities (3001 and 3028 s) in the light curve of V1405 Aql, a low mass X-ray Binary (LMXRB), has attracted the attention of many observers. Two basic competing models have been offered for this system. According to the first, V1405 Aql is a triple system. The second model invokes the presence of an accretion disc that precesses in the apsidal plane, suggesting that the shorter period is the orbital period while the longer is a positive superhump. The debate on the nature of V1405 Aql has been continued until very recently. Re-examination of previously published X-ray data reveals an additional periodicity of 2979 s, which is naturally interpreted as a negative superhump. The recently found 4.8-d period is consequently understood as the nodal precession of the disc. This is the first firm detection of negative superhumps and nodal precession in a LMXRB. Our results thus confirm the classification of V1405 Aql as a permanent superhump system. The 14-year argument on the nature of this intriguing object has thus finally come to an end. We find that the ratio between the negative superhump deficit (over the orbital period) and the positive superhump excess is a function of orbital period in systems that show both types of superhumps. This relation presents some challenge to theory as it fits binaries with different components. We propose that a thickening in the disc rim, which causes increased occultation of the X-ray source, is the mechanism responsible for both types of superhumps in LMXRBs. According to our model superhumps (both in the X-ray and optical regimes) are permitted in high inclination LMXRBs contrary to Haswell et al. (2001) prediction.

"  A supersaturated design is a design whose run size is not large enough for estimating all the main effects. The goodness of multi-level supersaturated designs can be judged by the generalized minimum aberration criterion proposed by Xu and Wu [Ann. Statist. 29 (2001) 1066--1077]. A new lower bound is derived and general construction methods are proposed for multi-level supersaturated designs. Inspired by the Addelman--Kempthorne construction of orthogonal arrays, several classes of optimal multi-level supersaturated designs are given in explicit form: Columns are labeled with linear or quadratic polynomials and rows are points over a finite field. Additive characters are used to study the properties of resulting designs. Some small optimal supersaturated designs of 3, 4 and 5 levels are listed with their properties.

"  Motivated by the HRRT-formula for holographic entanglement entropy, we consider the following question: what are the position and the surface area of extremal surfaces in a perturbed geometry, given their anchor on the asymptotic boundary? We derive explicit expressions for the change in position and surface area, thereby providing a closed form expression for the canonical energy. We find that a perturbation governed by some small parameter $\lambda$ yields an expansion of the surface area in terms of a highly non-local expression involving multiple integrals of geometric quantities over the original extremal surface.

"  We performed a series of resistivity measurements of a MnSi single crystal at high pressures, created by a piston-cylinder device with a liquid pressure medium. The form of the resistivity curve at ambient pressure clearly indicates a first order nature of the magnetic phase transition in MnSi. Application of high pressure shows fast degradation of the first order features of the phase transition. The temperature derivative of resistivity demonstrates two notable features of the phase transition that disappear on pressure increasing. They are a sharp peak marking the first order phase transition and a shallow maximum, situated slightly above the critical temperature and pointing to the domain of prominent helical fluctuations. The current experimental data rule out any strong first order phase transition in MnSi at high pressures and low temperatures, which would prevent development of a quantum critical region. On the contrary, there should exist true quantum critical phenomena in MnSi at high pressures because a tiny first order transition, if it survives at high pressures to the lowest temperature, hardly could suppress the entire quantum critical region.

"  Different types of ordering phenomena may occur during phase transitions, described within the universal framework of the Landau theory through the evolution of one, or several, symmetry-breaking order parameter h. In addition, many systems undergo phase transitions related to an electronic instability, in the absence of a symmetry-breaking and eventually described through the evolution of a totally symmetric order parameter q linearly coupled to volume change. Analyzing the coupling of a non-symmetry-breaking electronic instability, responsible for volume strain, to symmetry-breaking phenomena is of importance for many systems in nature and here we show that the symmetry-allowed qh2 coupling plays a central role. We use as case study the rubidium manganese hexacyanoferrate Prussian blue analogue, exhibiting phase transitions with hysteresis that may exceed 100 K, and based on intermetallic charge transfer (CT). During the phase transition, the intermetallic CT described through the evolution of q is coupled to cubic-tetragonal ferroelastic symmetry-breaking described through the evolution of h. In this system, the symmetry-breaking and non-symmetry breaking deformations have similar amplitudes but the large volume strain is mainly due to CT. We analyze both the ferroelastic and the CT features of the phase transition within the frame of the Landau theory, taking into account the qh2 coupling, stabilizing concomitant CT and Jahn-Teller distortion. The phase diagrams obtained with this model are in good qualitative agreement with various experimental findings and apply to diverse families of materials undergoing Mott transition, spin-crossover, neutral-ionic transition, for which isostructural electronic instability driving volume strain can couple to symmetry-breaking or not, create phase transition lines and drive cooperative phenomena.

We have shown that the duality works well in the Regge limit under two different extensions of the gauge theory: the introduction of a new scalar contact interaction and the relaxation of the distinguishability of the scalars. Both modifications correspond to theories obtained by dimensional reduction from higher-dimensional pure gauge theories.

"  We propose a generic protocol to experimentally measure the quantum metric tensor, a fundamental geometric property of quantum states. Our method is based on the observation that the excitation rate of a quantum state directly relates to components of the quantum metric upon applying a proper time-periodic modulation. We discuss the applicability of this scheme to generic two-level systems, where the Hamiltonian's parameters can be externally tuned, and also to the context of Bloch bands associated with lattice systems. As an illustration, we extract the quantum metric of the multi-band Hofstadter model. Moreover, we demonstrate how this method can be used to directly probe the spread functional, a quantity which sets the lower bound on the spread of Wannier functions and signals phase transitions. Our proposal offers a universal probe for quantum geometry, which could be readily applied in a wide range of physical settings, ranging from circuit-QED systems to ultracold atomic gases.

"  The generalized $k$-connectivity $\kappa_k(G)$ of a graph $G$ was introduced by Chartrand et al. in 1984. It is natural to introduce the concept of generalized $k$-edge-connectivity $\lambda_k(G)$. For general $k$, the generalized $k$-edge-connectivity of a complete graph is obtained. For $k\geq 3$, tight upper and lower bounds of $\kappa_k(G)$ and $\lambda_k(G)$ are given for a connected graph $G$ of order $n$, that is, $1\leq \kappa_k(G)\leq n-\lceil\frac{k}{2}\rceil$ and $1\leq \lambda_k(G)\leq n-\lceil\frac{k}{2}\rceil$. Graphs of order $n$ such that $\kappa_k(G)=n-\lceil\frac{k}{2}\rceil$ and $\lambda_k(G)=n-\lceil\frac{k}{2}\rceil$ are characterized, respectively. Nordhaus-Gaddum-type results for the generalized $k$-connectivity are also obtained. For $k=3$, we study the relation between the edge-connectivity and the generalized 3-edge-connectivity of a graph. Upper and lower bounds of $\lambda_3(G)$ for a graph $G$ in terms of the edge-connectivity $\lambda$ of $G$ are obtained, that is, $\frac{3\lambda-2}{4}\leq \lambda_3(G)\leq \lambda$, and two graph classes are given showing that the upper and lower bounds are tight. From these bounds, we obtain that $\lambda(G)-1\leq \lambda_3(G)\leq \lambda(G)$ if $G$ is a connected planar graph, and the relation between the generalized 3-connectivity and generalized 3-edge-connectivity of a graph and its line graph.

"  In this paper, we propose an approach named psc2code to denoise the process of extracting source code from programming screencasts. First, psc2code leverages the Convolutional Neural Network based image classification to remove non-code and noisy-code frames. Then, psc2code performs edge detection and clustering-based image segmentation to detect sub-windows in a code frame, and based on the detected sub-windows, it identifies and crops the screen region that is most likely to be a code editor. Finally, psc2code calls the API of a professional OCR tool to extract source code from the cropped code regions and leverages the OCRed cross-frame information in the programming screencast and the statistical language model of a large corpus of source code to correct errors in the OCRed source code.   We conduct an experiment on 1,142 programming screencasts from YouTube. We find that our CNN-based image classification technique can effectively remove the non-code and noisy-code frames, which achieves an F1-score of 0.95 on the valid code frames. Based on the source code denoised by psc2code, we implement two applications: 1) a programming screencast search engine; 2) an interaction-enhanced programming screencast watching tool. Based on the source code extracted from the 1,142 collected programming screencasts, our experiments show that our programming screencast search engine achieves the precision@5, 10, and 20 of 0.93, 0.81, and 0.63, respectively.

"  Massive evolved stars can produce large amounts of dust, and far-infrared (IR) data are essential for determining the contribution of cold dust to the total dust mass. Using Herschel, we search for cold dust in three very dusty massive evolved stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud: R71 is a Luminous Blue Variable, HD36402 is a Wolf-Rayet triple system, and IRAS05280-6910 is a red supergiant. We model the spectral energy distributions using radiative transfer codes and find that these three stars have mass-loss rates up to 10^-3 solar masses/year, suggesting that high-mass stars are important contributors to the life-cycle of dust. We found far-IR excesses in two objects, but these excesses appear to be associated with ISM and star-forming regions. Cold dust (T < 100 K) may thus not be an important contributor to the dust masses of evolved stars. ",Cold Dust in Three Massive Evolved Stars in the LMC

Knutson and Tao [J. Amer. Math. Soc. 12 (4) (1999) 1055--1090] proved an integrality theorem for so-called honeycombs, which is equivalent to the assertion that an integer-valued function on the boundary edges of $G$ is extendable to an integer concave cocirculation if it is extendable to a concave cocirculation at all. In this paper we show a sharper property: for any concave cocirculation $h$ in $G$, there exists an integer concave cocirculation $h'$ satisfying $h'(e)=h(e)$ for each boundary edge $e$ with $h(e)$ integer and for each edge $e$ contained in a bounded face where $h$ takes integer values on all edges. On the other hand, we explain that for a 3-side grid $G$ of size $n$, the polytope of concave cocirculations with fixed integer values on two sides of $G$ can have a vertex $h$ whose entries are integers on the third side but $h(e)$ has denominator $\Omega(n)$ for some interior edge $e$. Also some algorithmic aspects and related results on honeycombs are discussed. ",Integer concave cocirculations and honeycombs
"  The production of Like-Sign-Di-leptons (LSD), in the high energy lepton number violating ($\Delta L = +2$) reaction, p p --> 2jets + l+l+ (l=e,\mu,\tau) of interest for the experiments to be performed at the forthcoming Large Hadron Collider (LHC), is investigated in detail, taking up a composite model scenario in which the exchanged virtual composite neutrino is assumed to be a Majorana particle that couples to the light leptons via the $SU(2)\times U(1)$ gauge bosons through a magnetic type coupling ($\sigma_{\mu\nu}$). An helicity projection method is used to evaluate exactly the tree-level amplitudes of the contributing parton subprocesses ($2\to 4$), which allows to take into account all exchange diagrams and occurring interferences. Numerical estimates of the corresponding signal cross-section that implement kinematical cuts needed to suppress the Standard Model background, are presented which show that in some regions of the parameter space the total number of LSD events is well above the background. Assuming non-observation of the LSD signal it is found that LHC would exclude a composite Majorana neutrino up to 850 GeV (if one requires 10 events for discovery). The sensitivity of LHC experiments to the parameter space is then compared to that of the next generation of neutrinoless double beta decay ($\beta\beta_{0\nu}$) experiment, GENIUS, and it is shown that they will provide constraints of the same order of magnitude and will play a complementary role.

"  In this note we give a simple proof of the fact that the determinant of Laplace operator in smooth metric over compact Riemann surfaces of arbitrary genus $g$ monotonously grows under the normalized Ricci flow. Together with results of Hamilton that under the action of the normalized Ricci flow the smooth metric tends asymptotically to metric of constant curvature for $g\geq 1$, this leads to a simple proof of Osgood-Phillips-Sarnak theorem stating that that within the class of smooth metrics with fixed conformal class and fixed volume the determinant of Laplace operator is maximal on metric of constant curvatute.

"  Kato's second representation theorem is generalized to solvable sesquilinear forms. These forms need not be non-negative nor symmetric. The representation considered holds for a subclass of solvable forms (called hyper-solvable), precisely for those whose domain is exactly the domain of the square root of the modulus of the associated operator. This condition always holds for closed semibounded forms, and it is also considered by several authors for symmetric sign-indefinite forms. As a consequence, a one-to-one correspondence between hyper-solvable forms and operators, which generalizes those already known, is established.

"  With the emergence of low-cost smart and connected IoT devices, the area of cyber-physical security is becoming increasingly important. Past research has demonstrated new threat vectors targeting the transition process between the cyber and physical domains, where the attacker exploits the sensing system as an attack surface for signal injection or extraction of private information. Recently, there have been attempts to characterize an abstracted model for signal injection, but they primarily focus on the path of signal processing. This paper aims to systematize the existing research on security and privacy problems arising from the interaction of cyber world and physical world, with the context of broad CPS applications. The primary goals of the systematization are to (1) reveal the attack patterns and extract a general attack model of existing work, (2) understand possible new attacks, and (3) motivate development of defenses against the emerging cyber-physical threats.

"  We propose to combine cepstrum and nonlinear time-frequency (TF) analysis to study mutiple component oscillatory signals with time-varying frequency and amplitude and with time-varying non-sinusoidal oscillatory pattern. The concept of cepstrum is applied to eliminate the wave-shape function influence on the TF analysis, and we propose a new algorithm, named de-shape synchrosqueezing transform (de-shape SST). The mathematical model, adaptive non-harmonic model, is introduced and the de-shape SST algorithm is theoretically analyzed. In addition to simulated signals, several different physiological, musical and biological signals are analyzed to illustrate the proposed algorithm.

"  We compute the electromagnetic response and corresponding forces between two silver nanowires. The wires are illuminated by a plane wave which has the electric field vector perpendicular to the axis of the wires, insuring that plasmonic resonances can be excited. We consider a nontrivial square cross section geometry that has dimensions on the order of $0.1 \lambda$, where $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the incident electromagnetic field. We find that due to the plasmonic resonance, there occurs great enhancement of the direct and mutual electromagnetic forces that are exerted on the nanowires. The Lippman-Schwinger volume integral equation is implemented to obtain solutions to Maxwell's equations for various $\lambda$ and separation distances between wires. The forces are computed using Maxwell's stress tensor and numerical results are shown for both on and off resonant conditions.

"  Online privacy has gradually become a concern for internet users over the years as a result of the interconnection of customers devices with other devices supporting the internet technology. This research investigates and discusses the factors that influence the privacy concerns faced by online consumers of internet services and the possible outcomes of these privacy concerns on the African online market with Ghana being the primary focus. Results from this study indicated that only 10.1 percent of respondents felt that the internet was safe for purchase and payment transaction in Ghana. However, respondents were willing to shop online if e-Commerce was the only means of getting their products. Respondents also had a high sense of perceived vulnerability and their perceived vulnerability to unauthorized data collection and misuse of personal information could affect Ghanaian e-Commerce platform adoption. The perceived ability of users of e-Commerce platforms in Ghana to control data collection and its subsequent use by other third parties was also found to negatively impact customers willingness to wholly transact and share their personal information online. The perceived vulnerability was found to be affected by the high levels of internet illiteracy whiles the perceived ability to control the collection of information and use was influenced by both the internet literacy level as well as the level of social awareness of the Ghanaian internet consumer.

"  An intensive monitoring program of 54 6.7-GHz methanol maser sources was carried out at the Hartebeesthoek Radio Astronomy Observatory from January 1999 to April 2003. The monitoring program was subsequently continued on 19 sources of interest. Analysis of the resulting time-series stretching over eight years shows that six of the sources are periodic, with periods ranging from 133 days to 504 days. The waveforms in individual sources range from sinusoidal fluctuations to sharp flares and there can be other long term trends in the time-series. The amplitudes of the variations can also change from cycle to cycle. The time-series of the periodic masers will be presented, and possible causes of the variability discussed.

"  Using a multiscale computational approach, we probe the origin and evolution of ultraflatbands in moir\'e superlattices of twisted bilayer MoS$_2$, a prototypical transition metal dichalcogenide. Unlike twisted bilayer graphene, we find no unique magic angles in twisted bilayer MoS$_2$ for flatband formation. Ultraflatbands form at the valence band edge for twist angles ($\theta$) close to 0$^\circ$ and at both the valence and conduction band edges for $\theta$ close to 60$^\circ$, and have distinct origins. For$ \theta$ close to 0$^\circ$, inhomogeneous hybridization in the reconstructed moir\'e superlattice is sufficient to explain the formation of flatbands. For $\theta$ close to 60$^\circ$, additionally, local strains cause the formation of modulating triangular potential wells such that electrons and holes are spatially separated. This leads to multiple energy-separated ultraflatbands at the band edges closely resembling eigenfunctions of a quantum particle in an equilateral triangle well. Twisted bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides are thus suitable candidates for the realisation of ordered quantum dot array.

"  We consider a quantum mechanical model for the high-order harmonic generation in bulk solids. The bandgap is assumed to be considerably larger than the exciting photon energy. Using dipole approximation, the dynamical equations for different initial Bloch states are decoupled in the velocity gauge. Although there is no quantum mechanical interference between the time evolution of different initial states, the complete harmonic radiation results from the interference of fields emitted by all the initial (valence band) states. In particular, this interference is shown to be responsible for the suppression of the even order harmonics. The number of the observable harmonics (essentially the cutoff) is also determined by electromagnetic field interference.

"  The dynamic spin susceptibility (DSS) has a ubiquitous Lorentzian form in conventional materials with weak spin orbit coupling, whose spectral width characterizes the spin relaxation rate. We show that DSS has an unusual non-Lorentzian form in topological insulators, which are characterized by strong SOC. At zero temperature, the high frequency part of DSS is universal and increases in certain directions as $\omega^{d-1}$ with $d=2$ and 3 for surface states and Weyl semimetals, respectively, while for helical edge states, the interactions renormalize the exponent as $d=2K-1$ with $K$ the Luttinger-liquid parameter. As a result, spin relaxation rate cannot be deduced from the DSS in contrast to the case of usual metals, which follows from the strongly entangled spin and charge degrees of freedom in these systems. These parallel with the optical conductivity of neutral graphene. ",Unusual spin dynamics in topological insulators
"  For many applications of pulsed radiation, the time-history of the radiation intensity must be optimized to induce a desired time-history of conditions. This optimization is normally performed using multi-physics simulations of the system. The pulse shape is parametrized, and multiple simulations are performed in which the parameters are adjusted until the desired response is induced. These simulations are often computationally intensive, and the optimization by iteration of parameters in forward simulations is then expensive and slow. In many cases, the desired response can be expressed such that an instantaneous difference between the actual and desired response can be calculated. In principle, a computer program used to perform the forward simulation could be modified to adjust the instantaneous radiation drive automaticaly until the desired instantaneous response is achieved. Unfortunately, such modifications may be impracticable in a complicated multi-physics program. However, the computational time increment in such simulations is generally much shorter than the time scale of changes in the desired response. It is much more practicable to adjust the radiation source so that the response tends toward the desired value at later times. This relaxed in-situ optimization method can give an adequate design for a pulse shape in a single forward simulation, giving a typical gain in computational efficiency of tens to thousands. This approach was demonstrated for the design of laser pulse shapes to induce ramp loading to high pressure in target assemblies incorporating ablators of significantly different mechanical impedance than the sample, requiring complicated pulse shaping.

  The elements of the wide class of quantum universal enveloping algebras are prooved to be Hopf algebras $H$ with spectrum $Q(H)$ in the category of groups. Such quantum algebras are quantum groups for simply connected solvable Lie groups $P(H)$.

"  Classical Lie group theory provides a universal tool for calculating symmetry groups for systems of differential equations. However Lie's method is not as much effective in the case of integral or integro-differential equations as well as in the case of infinite systems of differential equations. This paper is aimed to survey the modern approaches to symmetries of integro-differential equations. As an illustration, an infinite symmetry Lie algebra is calculated for a system of integro-differential equations, namely the well-known Benney equations. The crucial idea is to look for symmetry generators in the form of canonical Lie-Backlund operators.

"  We present the results of a study of the time-averaged spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of eight flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) present in the second catalog of high energy sources detected beyond 50 GeV by the {\it Fermi}-Large Area Telescope (2FHL). Both leptonic and hadronic scenarios are adopted to explain the multi-wavelength SEDs and we find them to be marginally consistent with the 2FHL spectra above 50 GeV. We derive the expected degree of X-ray and $\gamma$-ray polarizations both for the average and elevated activity states and note that: (i) a hadronic radiative model consistently predicts a higher degree of high energy polarization compared to leptonic ones, and (ii) the X-ray polarization degree is higher than the $\gamma$-ray polarization in the leptonic scenario, but similar to the $\gamma$-ray polarization if the observed radiation is powered by hadronic processes. From the leptonic modeling, the location of the $\gamma$-ray emitting region is found to be at the outer edge of the broad line region (BLR) and is consistent with the $\gamma\gamma$ opacity estimates for the $\gamma$-ray absorption by the BLR. We conclude that a majority of the FSRQs could be detected by the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array, though future high energy polarimeters will be able to detect them only during elevated activity states, which could provide supportive evidence for the hadronic origin of the X-ray and $\gamma$-ray emission.

"  We investigate the properties of forced inertial modes of a rotating fluid inside a spherical shell. Our forcing is tidal like, but its main property is that it is on the large scales. Our solutions first confirm some analytical results obtained on a two-dimensional model by Ogilvie (2005). We also note that as the frequency of the forcing varies, the dissipation varies drastically if the Ekman number E is low (as is usually the case). We then investigate the three-dimensional case and compare the results to the foregoing model. These solutions show, like their 2D counterpart, a spiky dissipation curve when the frequency of the forcing is varied; they also display small frequency intervals where the viscous dissipation is independent of viscosity. However, we show that the response of the fluid in these frequency intervals is crucially dominated by the shear layer that is emitted at the critical latitude on the inner sphere. The asymptotic regime is reached when an attractor has been excited by this shear layer. This property is not shared by the two-dimensional model. Finally, resonances of the three-dimensional model correspond to some selected least-damped eigenmodes. Unlike their two-dimensional counter parts these modes are not associated with simple attractors; instead, they show up in frequency intervals with a weakly contracting web of characteristics. Besides, we show that the inner core is negligible when its relative radius is less than the critical value 0.4E^{1/5}. For these spherical shells, the full sphere solutions give a good approximation of the flows (abridged abstract).

"  The longitudinal spin-Seebeck effect (SSE) in magnetic insulator$|$non-magnetic metal heterostructures has been theoretically studied primarily with the assumption of an isotropic interfacial exchange coupling. Here, we present a general theory of the SSE in the case of an antisymmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) at the interface, in addition to the usual Heisenberg form. We numerically evaluate the dependence of the spin current on the temperature and bulk DMI using a pyrochlore iridate as a model insulator with all-in all-out (AIAO) ground state configuration. We also compare the results of different crystalline surfaces arising from different crystalline orientations and conclude that the relative angles between the interfacial moments and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya vectors play a significant role in the spin transfer. Our work extends the theory of the SSE by including the anisotropic nature of the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya exchange interaction in magnetic insulator$|$non-magnetic metal heterostructures and can suggest possible materials to optimize the interfacial spin transfer in spintronic devices.

"  In this article we develop a highly integrated effective degree approach to modeling epidemic and awareness spreading processes on multiplex networks coupled with awareness-dependent adaptive rewiring. This approach keeps track of the number of nearest neighbors in each state of an individual; consequently, it allows for the integration of changes in local contacts into the multiplex network model. We derive a formula for the threshold condition of contagion outbreak; also, we provide a lower bound for the threshold parameter to indicate the effect of adaptive rewiring. The threshold analysis is confirmed by extensive simulations. Our results show that awareness-dependent link rewiring plays an important role in enhancing the transmission threshold as well as lowering the epidemic prevalence. Moreover, it is revealed that intensified awareness diffusion in conjunction with enhanced link rewiring makes a greater contribution to disease prevention and control. In addition, the critical phenomenon is observed in the dependence of the epidemic threshold on the awareness diffusion rate, supporting the metacritical point previously reported in the literature. This work might shed light on the understanding of the interplay between epidemic dynamics and social contagion on adaptive networks.

"  We present a model for the interaction of the GD-1 stellar stream with a massive perturber that naturally explains many of the observed stream features, including a gap and an off-stream spur of stars. The model involves an impulse by a fast encounter, after which the stream grows a loop of stars at different orbital energies. At specific viewing angles, this loop appears offset from the stream track. A quantitative comparison of the spur and gap features prefers models where the perturber is in the mass range of $10^6\,\rm M_\odot$ to $10^8\,\rm M_\odot$. Orbit integrations back in time show that the stream encounter could not have been caused by any known globular cluster or dwarf galaxy with a determined orbit, and mass, size and impact-parameter arguments show that it could not have been caused by a molecular cloud in the Milky Way disk. The most plausible explanation for the gap-and-spur structure is an encounter with a dark-matter substructure, like those predicted to populate galactic halos in LCDM cosmology. However, the expected densities of LCDM subhalos in this mass range and in this part of the Milky Way are $2-3\,\sigma$ lower than the inferred density of the GD-1 perturber. This observation opens up the possibility that detailed observations of streams could measure the mass spectrum of dark-matter substructures and even identify individual substructures and their orbits in the Galactic halo.

"  Two-photon interference is widely used in quantum information processing, e.g., state engineering and designing quantum gates, as well as in quantum sensing and metrology. This includes the generation and characterization of N00N states, which provide a phase measurement sensitivity that is beyond the shot-noise limit. There have been numerous efforts in generating N00N states with a photon number higher than 2, since their measurement sensitivity increases with N. Both photon number state and modal (temporal, spectral, and spatial) properties of light offer advantages in sensing, where the latter is achieved through mode-multiplexed measurements. Here, we experimentally demonstrate, with the aid of a recently developed photon-detection technology, measurement and characterization of up to tera-mode spatiotemporal correlations in two-photon interference and use it to generate high-dimensional two-photon N00N-states, which can be advantageous for multiphase estimation. We observe a high bi-photon interference and coalescence visibility of $\sim64\%$ and $\sim88\%$ for a tera ($10^{12}$) and 0.2 tera ($2\times 10^{11}$) spatiotemporal modes, respectively. These results open up a route for practical applications of using the spatiotemporal degrees of freedom in two-photon interference, and in particular, for quantum sensing and communication.

"  For elliptic systems with block structure in the upper half-space and t-independent coefficients, we settle the study of boundary value problems by proving compatible well-posedness of Dirichlet, regularity and Neumann problems in optimal ranges of exponents. Prior to this work, only the two-dimensional situation was fully understood. In higher dimensions, partial results for existence in smaller ranges of exponents and for a subclass of such systems had been established. The presented uniqueness results are completely new. We also elucidate optimal ranges for problems with fractional regularity data. Methods use and improve, with some new results, all the machinery developed over the last two decades to study such problems: the Kato square root estimates and Riesz transforms, Hardy spaces associated to operators, off-diagonal estimates, non-tangential estimates and square functions and abstract layer potentials to replace fundamental solutions in the absence of local regularity of solutions. This self-contained monograph provides a comprehensive overview on the field and unifies many earlier results that have been obtained by a variety of methods.

"  We study the spectra of non-regular semisimple elements in irreducible representations of simple algebraic groups. More precisely, we prove that if G is a simply connected simple linear algebraic group and f is a non-trivial irreducible representation of G in some GL(V) for which there exists a non-regular non-central semisimple element s in G such that f(s) has almost simple spectrum, then, with few exceptions, G is of classical type and dim V is minimal possible. Here the spectrum of a diagonalizable matrix is called simple if all eigenvalues are of multiplicity 1, and almost simple if at most one eigenvalue is of multiplicity greater than 1. This yields a kind of characterization of the natural representation (up to their Frobenius twists) of classical algebraic groups in terms of the behavior of semisimple elements.

"  In this paper, a new probability distribution, referred to as the matrix Fisher-Gaussian (MFG) distribution, is proposed on the nonlinear manifold $\mathrm{SO}(3)\times\mathbb{R}^n$. It is constructed by conditioning a (9+n)-variate Gaussian distribution from the ambient Euclidean space into $\mathrm{SO}(3)\times\mathbb{R}^n$, while imposing a certain geometric interpretation of the correlation terms to avoid over-parameterization. The unique feature is that it may represent large uncertainties in attitudes, linear variables of an arbitrary dimension, and angular-linear correlations between them in a global fashion without singularities associated with local parameterizations. Various stochastic properties and an approximate maximum likelihood estimator of MFG are developed. Furthermore, two methods are developed to propagate uncertainties though a stochastic differential equation representing attitude kinematics. Based on these, a Bayesian estimator is proposed to estimate the attitude and time-varying gyro bias concurrently. Numerical studies indicate that the proposed estimator exhibits a better accuracy against the well-established multiplicative extended Kalman filter for two challenging cases.

Villegas-Vallecillos in the case of non-separable and unbounded metric spaces. After studying the behavior of weakly convergent sequences made of finitely supported elements in Lipschitz-free spaces, we also deduce that $\widehat{f}$ is compact if and only if it is weakly compact.

"  In this article, we study a notion of the extraction rate of Turing functionals that translate between notions of randomness with respect to different underlying probability measures. We analyze several classes of extraction procedures: a first class that generalizes von Neumann's trick for extracting unbiased randomness from the tosses of a biased coin, a second class based on work of generating biased randomness from unbiased randomness by Knuth and Yao, and a third class independently developed by Levin and Kautz that generalizes the data compression technique of arithmetic coding. For the first two classes of extraction procedures, we identify a level of algorithmic randomness for an input that guarantees that we attain the extraction rate along that input, while for the third class, we calculate the rate attained along sufficiently random input sequences.

"  Sampled-data (SD) systems, which are composed of both discrete- and continuous-time components, are arguably one of the most common classes of cyberphysical systems in practice; most modern controllers are implemented on digital platforms while the plant dynamics that are being controlled evolve continuously in time. As with all cyberphysical systems, ensuring hard constraint satisfaction is key in the safe operation of SD systems. A powerful analytical tool for guaranteeing such constraint satisfaction is the viability kernel: the set of all initial conditions for which a safety-preserving control law (that is, a control law that satisfies all input and state constraints) exists. In this paper we present a novel sampling-based algorithm that tightly approximates the viability kernel for high-dimensional sampled-data linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. Unlike prior work in this area, our algorithm formally handles both the discrete and continuous characteristics of SD systems. We prove the correctness and convergence of our approximation technique, provide discussions on heuristic methods to optimally bias the sampling process, and demonstrate the results on a twelve-dimensional flight envelope protection problem.

"  In this letter we show by means of first principle numerical simulations that electron-hole interaction significantly contributes to the second-harmonic generation spectrum of h-BN or MoS$_2$ monolayers. Specifically, it doubles the signal intensity at the excitonic resonances with respect to the contribution from independent electronic transitions. This result hints that the intensity of second-harmonic signal of those materials can be tuned by changing the dielectric screening, that controls the strength of the electron-hole interaction.

"  Whilst there has been growing progress in Entity Linking (EL) for general language, existing datasets fail to address the complex nature of health terminology in layman's language. Meanwhile, there is a growing need for applications that can understand the public's voice in the health domain. To address this we introduce a new corpus called COMETA, consisting of 20k English biomedical entity mentions from Reddit expert-annotated with links to SNOMED CT, a widely-used medical knowledge graph. Our corpus satisfies a combination of desirable properties, from scale and coverage to diversity and quality, that to the best of our knowledge has not been met by any of the existing resources in the field. Through benchmark experiments on 20 EL baselines from string- to neural-based models we shed light on the ability of these systems to perform complex inference on entities and concepts under 2 challenging evaluation scenarios. Our experimental results on COMETA illustrate that no golden bullet exists and even the best mainstream techniques still have a significant performance gap to fill, while the best solution relies on combining different views of data.

This H-alpha survey reveals a complex spatial and kinematic structure in the warm ionized medium and provides a foundation for studies of the temperature and ionization state of the gas, the spectrum and strength of the ionizing radiation, and its relationship to other components of the interstellar medium and sources of ionization and heating within the Galactic disk and halo.

"  Carbon nanowall (CNW) is a two dimensional graphitic nanostructures with many potential applications like field emission, catalyst support for fuel cell and negative electrode for batteries. CNWs were grown here on Si substrates by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition using N2/CH4 plasma at 6500C temperature. Deposited CNWs were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy. Results obtained by Raman spectroscopic techniques are extensively studied. It shows existence of D, G, D/, G/, and D+D/ bands. These bands are analyzed to obtain detail structural information about CNWs. Analysis of each Raman band is done using a Lorentzian fit and their significance have been explained from the perspectives of CNWs. Different bands appeared in Raman spectra of CNWs have further been compared with of the same bands of graphene, single-wall and multi-wall nanotubes. Similarities and differences of CNWs with these carbon nanostructures have been pointed out during analysis. Our detailed analysis of the experimental results shows that CNWs have close similarity to turbostratic graphite i.e. with substantial amount of defects present in the graphene sheets stacked over one another.

"  The quantum master equation obtained from two different thermodynamic arguments is seriously nonlinear. We argue that, for quantum systems, nonlinearity occurs naturally in the step from reversible to irreversible equations and we analyze the nature and consequences of the nonlinear contribution. The thermodynamic nonlinearity naturally leads to canonical equilibrium solutions and extends the range of validity to lower temperatures. We discuss the Markovian character of the thermodynamic quantum master equation and introduce a solution strategy based on coupled evolution equations for the eigenstates and eigenvalues of the density matrix. The general ideas are illustrated for the two-level system and for the damped harmonic oscillator. Several conceptual implications of the nonlinearity of the thermodynamic quantum master equation are pointed out, including the absence of a Heisenberg picture and the resulting difficulties with defining multi-time correlations.

"  We have obtained evidence of gamma-ray emission above 1 TeV from PSR1706-44, using a ground-based telescope of the atmospheric \v{C}erenkov imaging type located near Woomera, South Australia. This object, a $\gamma$-ray source discovered by the COS B satellite (2CG342-02), was identified with the radio pulsar through the discovery of a 102 ms pulsed signal with the EGRET instrument of the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory. The flux of the present observation above a threshold of 1 TeV is $\bf \sim $ 1 $\cdot$ 10$^{-11}$ photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, which is two orders of magnitude smaller than the extrapolation from GeV energies. The analysis is not restricted to a search for emission modulated with the 102 ms period, and the reported flux is for all $\gamma$-rays from PSR1706-44, pulsed and unpulsed. The energy output in the TeV region corresponds to about 10$^{-3}$ of the spin down energy loss rate of the neutron star. ",Very High Energy Gamma Rays from PSR1706-44
"  Multitask learning is being increasingly adopted in applications domains like computer vision and reinforcement learning. However, optimally exploiting its advantages remains a major challenge due to the effect of negative transfer. Previous works have tracked down this issue to the disparities in gradient magnitudes and directions across tasks, when optimizing the shared network parameters. While recent work has acknowledged that negative transfer is a two-fold problem, existing approaches fall short as they only focus on either homogenizing the gradient magnitude across tasks; or greedily change the gradient directions, overlooking future conflicts. In this work, we introduce RotoGrad, an algorithm that tackles negative transfer as a whole: it jointly homogenizes gradient magnitudes and directions, while ensuring training convergence. We show that RotoGrad outperforms competing methods in complex problems, including multi-label classification in CelebA and computer vision tasks in the NYUv2 dataset. A Pytorch implementation can be found in https://github.com/adrianjav/rotograd . ",RotoGrad: Gradient Homogenization in Multitask Learning
"  The polarized strange quark puzzle concerns the fact that the polarized strange quark density extracted from polarized inclusive deep inelastic scattering data is significantly negative, whereas it is zero or slightly positive when extracted from a combined analysis of polarized semi-inclusive and inclusive deep inelastic data. SU(3) flavor symmetry, which, it is generally accepted, is not an exact symmetry, plays an important role in the inclusive analysis, and all the extracted polarized quark densities depend, to some extent, on the level of symmetry breaking introduced. But by far the most sensitive to the breaking is the strange quark density. In this paper we present a NLO QCD analysis of the world data on polarized inclusive DIS data on protons, neutrons and deuterons, including the final JLAB CLAS/EG1b data on the proton and deuteron, and study the sensitivity of the strange quark polarization to the breaking of flavor SU(3).

"  We introduce a stochastic algorithm that acts as a prime number generator. The dynamics of such algorithm gives rise to a continuous phase transition which separates a phase where the algorithm is able to reduce a whole set of integers into primes and a phase where the system reaches a frozen state with low prime density. We present both numerical simulations and an analytical approach in terms of an annealed approximation, by means of which the data are collapsed. A critical slowing down phenomenon is also outlined.

"  Image perceptual hashing finds applications in content indexing, large-scale image database management, certification and authentication and digital watermarking. We propose a Block-DCT and PCA based image perceptual hash in this article and explore the algorithm in the application of tamper detection. The main idea of the algorithm is to integrate color histogram and DCT coefficients of image blocks as perceptual feature, then to compress perceptual features as inter-feature with PCA, and to threshold to create a robust hash. The robustness and discrimination properties of the proposed algorithm are evaluated in detail. Our algorithms first construct a secondary image, derived from input image by pseudo-randomly extracting features that approximately capture semi-global geometric characteristics. From the secondary image (which does not perceptually resemble the input), we further extract the final features which can be used as a hash value (and can be further suitably quantized). In this paper, we use spectral matrix invariants as embodied by Singular Value Decomposition. Surprisingly, formation of the secondary image turns out be quite important since it not only introduces further robustness, but also enhances the security properties. Indeed, our experiments reveal that our hashing algorithms extract most of the geometric information from the images and hence are robust to severe perturbations (e.g. up to %50 cropping by area with 20 degree rotations) on images while avoiding misclassification. Experimental results show that the proposed image perceptual hash algorithm can effectively address the tamper detection problem with advantageous robustness and discrimination.

"  We study the problem of the damping of collective modes close to a Pomeranchuk quantum critical point in a Fermi liquid. In analogy with problems in dissipative open quantum systems, we derive the Landau damping of a Fermi liquid by integrating out a macroscopic number of degrees of freedom from a generating functional. Being a reformulation of the linearized Boltzmann equation this approach reproduces well-known results from the theory of Fermi liquids. We also study the Bethe-Salpeter equations within the Landau theory and discuss the implications of these results on quantum phase transitions of the Pomeranchuk type and its dynamical exponent, z. We apply our results to the electronic nematic instability and find z=3 in the collisionless limit. ",Heat Bath Approach to Landau Damping and Pomeranchuk Quantum Critical   Points
"  We extend the classification of free fermionic heterotic-string models to vacua in which the SO(10) GUT symmetry is broken at the string level to the Pati-Salam subgroup. Using our classification method we recently presented the first example of a quasi--realistic heterotic-string vacuum that is free of massless exotic states. Within this method we are able to derive algebraic expressions for the generalised GSO projections for all sectors that appear in the models. This facilitates the programming of the entire spectrum analysis in a computer code. The total number of vacua in the class of models that we classify is 2^{51} ~ 10^{15}. We perform a statistical sampling in this space of models and extract 10^{11} distinct configurations with Pati-Salam gauge group. Our results demonstrate that one in every 10^{6} vacua correspond to a three generation exophobic model with the required Higgs states, needed to induce spontaneous breaking to the Standard Model.

  We discuss bulk viscosity due to non-leptonic processes involving hyperons and Bose-Einstein condensate of negatively charged kaons in neutron stars. It is noted that the hyperon bulk viscosity coefficient is a few order of magnitude larger than that of the case with the condensate. Further it is found that the hyperon bulk viscosity is suppressed in a superconducting phase. The hyperon bulk viscosity efficiently damps the r-mode instability in neutron stars irrespective of whether a superconducting phase is present or not in neutron star interior. ,Bulk viscosity of strange matter and r-modes in neutron stars
"  We present a new approach for performing predicate abstraction based on symbolic decision procedures. Intuitively, a symbolic decision procedure for a theory takes a set of predicates in the theory and symbolically executes a decision procedure on all the subsets over the set of predicates. The result of the symbolic decision procedure is a shared expression (represented by a directed acyclic graph) that implicitly represents the answer to a predicate abstraction query.   We present symbolic decision procedures for the logic of Equality and Uninterpreted Functions (EUF) and Difference logic (DIFF) and show that these procedures run in pseudo-polynomial (rather than exponential) time. We then provide a method to construct symbolic decision procedures for simple mixed theories (including the two theories mentioned above) using an extension of the Nelson-Oppen combination method. We present preliminary evaluation of our Procedure on predicate abstraction benchmarks from device driver verification in SLAM. ",Predicate Abstraction via Symbolic Decision Procedures
"  An increasing number of works in natural language processing have addressed the effect of bias on the predicted outcomes, introducing mitigation techniques that act on different parts of the standard NLP pipeline (data and models). However, these works have been conducted in isolation, without a unifying framework to organize efforts within the field. This leads to repetitive approaches, and puts an undue focus on the effects of bias, rather than on their origins. Research focused on bias symptoms rather than the underlying origins could limit the development of effective countermeasures. In this paper, we propose a unifying conceptualization: the predictive bias framework for NLP. We summarize the NLP literature and propose a general mathematical definition of predictive bias in NLP along with a conceptual framework, differentiating four main origins of biases: label bias, selection bias, model overamplification, and semantic bias. We discuss how past work has countered each bias origin. Our framework serves to guide an introductory overview of predictive bias in NLP, integrating existing work into a single structure and opening avenues for future research.

"  We present the analysis of the 1/Q-suppressed non-perturbative (NP) contribution to the cumulative out-of-event-plane momentum distribution in e+e- annihilation in the near-to-planar three-jet region. It complements our previous study of the perturbative (PT) distributions resummed to single logarithmic accuracy. Due to inter-jet soft gluon radiation, the NP contributions (as well as the PT distributions) are sensitive to the geometry (the angles between jets) and the colour structure of the underlying hard process (topology of the three-prong parton antenna). The results and techniques presented here could be extended to other multi-jet processes and, in particular, to hadron-hadron collisions.

"  Given a string $S$, the \emph{compressed indexing problem} is to preprocess $S$ into a compressed representation that supports fast \emph{substring queries}. The goal is to use little space relative to the compressed size of $S$ while supporting fast queries. We present a compressed index based on the Lempel--Ziv 1977 compression scheme. We obtain the following time-space trade-offs: For constant-sized alphabets; (i) $O(m + occ \lg\lg n)$ time using $O(z\lg(n/z)\lg\lg z)$ space, or (ii) $O(m(1 + \frac{\lg^\epsilon z}{\lg(n/z)}) + occ(\lg\lg n + \lg^\epsilon z))$ time using $O(z\lg(n/z))$ space. For integer alphabets polynomially bounded by $n$; (iii) $O(m(1 + \frac{\lg^\epsilon z}{\lg(n/z)}) + occ(\lg\lg n + \lg^\epsilon z))$ time using $O(z(\lg(n/z) + \lg\lg z))$ space, or (iv) $O(m + occ(\lg\lg n + \lg^{\epsilon} z))$ time using $O(z(\lg(n/z) + \lg^{\epsilon} z))$ space, where $n$ and $m$ are the length of the input string and query string respectively, $z$ is the number of phrases in the LZ77 parse of the input string, $occ$ is the number of occurrences of the query in the input and $\epsilon > 0$ is an arbitrarily small constant. In particular, (i) improves the leading term in the query time of the previous best solution from $O(m\lg m)$ to $O(m)$ at the cost of increasing the space by a factor $\lg \lg z$. Alternatively, (ii) matches the previous best space bound, but has a leading term in the query time of $O(m(1+\frac{\lg^{\epsilon} z}{\lg (n/z)}))$. However, for any polynomial compression ratio, i.e., $z = O(n^{1-\delta})$, for constant $\delta > 0$, this becomes $O(m)$. Our index also supports extraction of any substring of length $\ell$ in $O(\ell + \lg(n/z))$ time. Technically, our results are obtained by novel extensions and combinations of existing data structures of independent interest, including a new batched variant of weak prefix search.

"  A distributed network is modeled by a graph having $n$ nodes (processors) and diameter $D$. We study the time complexity of approximating {\em weighted} (undirected) shortest paths on distributed networks with a $O(\log n)$ {\em bandwidth restriction} on edges (the standard synchronous \congest model). The question whether approximation algorithms help speed up the shortest paths (more precisely distance computation) was raised since at least 2004 by Elkin (SIGACT News 2004). The unweighted case of this problem is well-understood while its weighted counterpart is fundamental problem in the area of distributed approximation algorithms and remains widely open. We present new algorithms for computing both single-source shortest paths (\sssp) and all-pairs shortest paths (\apsp) in the weighted case.   Our main result is an algorithm for \sssp. Previous results are the classic $O(n)$-time Bellman-Ford algorithm and an $\tilde O(n^{1/2+1/2k}+D)$-time $(8k\lceil \log (k+1) \rceil -1)$-approximation algorithm, for any integer $k\geq 1$, which follows from the result of Lenzen and Patt-Shamir (STOC 2013). (Note that Lenzen and Patt-Shamir in fact solve a harder problem, and we use $\tilde O(\cdot)$ to hide the $O(\poly\log n)$ term.) We present an $\tilde O(n^{1/2}D^{1/4}+D)$-time $(1+o(1))$-approximation algorithm for \sssp. This algorithm is {\em sublinear-time} as long as $D$ is sublinear, thus yielding a sublinear-time algorithm with almost optimal solution. When $D$ is small, our running time matches the lower bound of $\tilde \Omega(n^{1/2}+D)$ by Das Sarma et al. (SICOMP 2012), which holds even when $D=\Theta(\log n)$, up to a $\poly\log n$ factor.

"  We study the fine tuning in the parameter space of the semi-constrained NMSSM, where most soft Susy breaking parameters are universal at the GUT scale. We discuss the dependence of the fine tuning on the soft Susy breaking parameters M_1/2 and m0, and on the Higgs masses in NMSSM specific scenarios involving large singlet-doublet Higgs mixing or dominant Higgs-to-Higgs decays. Whereas these latter scenarios allow a priori for considerably less fine tuning than the constrained MSSM, the early LHC results rule out a large part of the parameter space of the semi-constrained NMSSM corresponding to low values of the fine tuning.

"  We present a new formulation of the loop-tree duality theorem for higher loop diagrams valid both for massless and massive cases. $l$-loop integrals are expressed as weighted sum of trees obtained from cutting $l$ internal propagators of the loop graph. In addition, the uncut propagators gain a modified $i \delta$-prescription, named dual-propagators. In this new framework one can go beyond graphs and calculate the integrand of loop amplitudes as a weighted sum of tree graphs, which form a tree-like object. These objects can be computed efficiently via recurrence relations. ",A new formulation of the loop-tree duality at higher loops
"  We consider a dynamical process on a graph $G$, in which vertices are infected (randomly) at a rate which depends on the number of their neighbours that are already infected.

We give a precise description of the evolution of this process on the graph $\mathbb{Z}^2$, significantly sharpening results of Dehghanpour and Schonmann. In particular, we determine the typical infection time up to a constant factor for almost all natural values of the parameters, and in a large range we obtain a stronger, sharp threshold.

"  All four giant planets in the Solar System feature zonal flows on the order of 100 m/s in the cloud deck, and large-scale intrinsic magnetic fields on the order of 1 Gauss near the surface. The vertical structure of the zonal flows remains obscure. The end-member scenarios are shallow flows confined in the radiative atmosphere and deep flows throughout the entire planet. The electrical conductivity increases rapidly yet smoothly as a function of depth inside Jupiter and Saturn. Deep zonal flows will inevitably interact with the magnetic field, at depth with even modest electrical conductivity. Here we investigate the interaction between zonal flows and magnetic fields in the semi-conducting region of giant planets. Employing mean-field electrodynamics, we show that the interaction will generate detectable poloidal magnetic field perturbations spatially correlated with the deep zonal flows. Assuming the peak amplitude of the dynamo alpha-effect to be 0.1 mm/s, deep zonal flows on the order of 0.1 - 1 m/s in the semi-conducting region of Jupiter and Saturn would generate poloidal magnetic perturbations on the order of 0.01% - 1% of the background dipole field. These poloidal perturbations should be detectable with the in-situ magnetic field measurements from the Juno mission and the Cassini Grand Finale. This implies that magnetic field measurements can be employed to constrain the properties of deep zonal flows in the semi-conducting region of giant planets.

"  The strictly reversible, thermodynamically equilibrium nature of the free rotation of a body makes it possible to obtain a number of bounds on the rotational characteristics within individual rotational bands of nonspherical nuclei. As a result, the bounds between which the possible values of the critical spin $J_c$ lie can be expressed exclusively in terms of a restricted number of the experimentally most accessible data on the lower phase $J<J_c$ for a given nuclide. The bounds are tested on the ground-state rotational bands (yrast lines) of even-even nuclei, in which the corresponding phase transition (backbending) has already been observed experimentally. For nuclei with pronounced non-sphericity, all the bounds are invariably confirmed. For the ground-state rotational bands for which the phase transition point $J =J_c$ has not yet been reached, predictions are made for the corresponding values of $J_c^{min}$ and, especially, $J_c^{max}$. The specific features of excited rotational bands, and also the bands of odd nuclei are discussed. ",Thermodynamic inequalities for nuclear rotation
"  The binary millisecond radio pulsar PSR J1023+0038 exhibits many characteristics similar to the gamma-ray binary system PSR B1259--63/LS 2883, making it an ideal candidate for the study of high-energy non-thermal emission. It has been the subject of multi-wavelength campaigns following the disappearance of the pulsed radio emission in 2013 June, which revealed the appearance of an accretion disk around the neutron star. We present the results of very high-energy gamma-ray observations carried out by VERITAS before and after this change of state. Searches for steady and pulsed emission of both data sets yield no significant gamma-ray signal above 100 GeV, and upper limits are given for both a steady and pulsed gamma-ray flux. These upper limits are used to constrain the magnetic field strength in the shock region of the PSR J1023+0038 system.

The ~10-minute flaring duration corresponds to the epoch when the radio beam sweeps our line of sight. The bursting epoch corresponds to the episodes when stronger sunspot-like magnetic fields emerge into the white dwarf polar cap region during which the pair production condition is satisfied and the white dwarf behaves like a radio pulsar.

"  Inversion codes for the polarized radiative transfer equation can be used to infer the temperature $T$, line-of-sight velocity $v_{\rm los}$, and magnetic field $\rm{\bf B}$ as a function of the continuum optical-depth $\tau_{\rm c}$. However, they do not directly provide the gas pressure $P_{\rm g}$ or density $\rho$. In order to obtain these latter parameters, inversion codes rely instead on the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium (HE) in addition to the equation of state (EOS). Unfortunately, the assumption of HE is rather unrealistic across magnetic field lines. This is because the role of the Lorentz force, among other factors, is neglected. This translates into an inaccurate conversion from optical depth $\tau_{\rm c}$ to geometrical height $z$. We aim at improving this conversion via the application of magneto-hydrostatic (MHS) equilibrium instead of HE. We develop a method to solve the momentum equation under MHS equilibrium (i.e., taking the Lorentz force into account) in three dimensions. The method is based on the solution of a Poisson-like equation. Considering the gas pressure $P_{\rm g}$ and density $\rho$ from three-dimensional magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of sunspots as a benchmark, we compare the results from the application of HE and MHS equilibrium. We find that HE retrieves the gas pressure and density within an order of magnitude of the MHD values in only about 47 \% of the domain. This translates into an error of about $160-200$ km in the determination of the $z-\tau_{\rm c}$ conversion. On the other hand, the application of MHS equilibrium allows determination of $P_{\rm g}$ and $\rho$ within an order of magnitude in 84 \% of the domain. In this latter case, the $z-\tau_{\rm c}$ conversion is obtained with an accuracy of $30-70$ km. ",Combining magneto-hydrostatic constraints with Stokes profiles   inversions
"  Small amounts of star formation in elliptical galaxies are suggested by several results: surprisingly young ages from optical line indices, cooling X-ray gas, and mid-IR dust emission. Such star formation has previously been difficult to directly detect, but using UV Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) imaging, we have identified individual young stars and star clusters in four nearby ellipticals. This technique is orders of magnitude more sensitive than other methods, allowing detections of star formation to 10^(-5) Msun/yr. Ongoing star formation is detected in all galaxies, including three ellipticals that have previously exhibited potential signposts of star forming conditions (NGC 4636, NGC 4697, and NGC 4374), as well as the typical ""red and dead"" NGC 3379. The current star formation in our closest targets, where we are most complete, is between 1-8x10^(-5) Msun/yr. The star formation history was roughly constant from 0.5-1.5 Gyr (at 3-5x10^(-4) Msun/yr), but decreased by a factor of several in the past 0.3 Gyr. Most star clusters have a mass between 10^2 - 10^4 Msun. The specific star formation rates of ~10^(-16) yr^(-1) (at the present day) or ~10^(-14) yr^(-1) (when averaging over the past Gyr) imply that a fraction 10^(-8) of the stellar mass is younger than 100 Myr and 10^(-5) is younger than 1 Gyr, quantifying the level of frosting of recent star formation over the otherwise passive stellar population. There is no obvious correlation between either the presence or spatial distribution of postulated star formation indicators and the star formation we detect.

"  Motivated by the analysis of the propagation of internal waves in a stratified ocean, we consider in this article the incompressible Euler equations with variable density in a flat strip, and we study the evolution of perturbations of the hydrostatic equilibrium corresponding to a stable vertical strati-fication of the density. We show the local well-posedness of the equations in this configuration and provide a detailed study of their linear approximation. Performing a modal decomposition according to a Sturm-Liouville problem associated to the background stratification, we show that the linear approximation can be described by a series of dispersive perturbations of linear wave equations. When the so called Brunt-Vais{\""a}l{\""a} frequency is not constant, we show that these equations are coupled, hereby exhibiting a phenomenon of dispersive mixing. We then consider more specifically shallow water configurations (when the horizontal scale is much larger than the depth); under the Boussinesq approximation (i.e. neglecting the density variations in the momentum equation), we provide a well-posedness theorem for which we are able to control the existence time in terms of the relevant physical scales. We can then extend the modal decomposition to the nonlinear case and exhibit a non-linear mixing of different nature than the dispersive mixing mentioned above. Finally, we discuss some perspectives such as the sharp stratification limit that is expected to converge towards two-fluids systems.

"  The Bayesian approach has become increasingly popular because it allows to model quite complex models via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. However, it is also recognized nowadays that MCMC sampling can become computationally prohibitive when a complex model needs to be fit to a large data set. To overcome this problem, we applied and extended a recently proposed two-stage approach to model a complex hierarchical data structure of glaucoma patients who participate in an ongoing Dutch study. Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of blindness in the world. In order to detect deterioration at an early stage, a model for predicting visual fields (VF) in time is needed. Hence, the true underlying VF progression can be determined, and treatment strategies can then be optimized to prevent further VF loss. Since we were unable to fit these data with the classical one-stage approach upon which the current popular Bayesian software is based, we made use of the two-stage Bayesian approach. The considered hierarchical longitudinal model involves estimating a large number of random effects and deals with censoring and high measurement variability. In addition, we extended the approach with tools for model evaluation ",Bayesian Hierarchical Modeling of Longitudinal Glaucomatous Visual   Fields using a Two-Stage Approach
"  Quantum cryptography holds the promise to establish an information-theoretically secure global network. All field tests of metropolitan-scale quantum networks to date are based on trusted relays. The security critically relies on the accountability of the trusted relays, which will break down if the relay is dishonest or compromised. Here, we construct a measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDIQKD) network in a star topology over a 200 square kilometers metropolitan area, which is secure against untrustful relays and against all detection attacks. In the field test, our system continuously runs through one week with a secure key rate ten times larger than previous result. Our results demonstrate that the MDIQKD network, combining the best of both worlds --- security and practicality, constitutes an appealing solution to secure metropolitan communications.

"  (Abridged). In this paper, we present results from a large set of numerical simulations that demonstrate that H2 formation occurs rapidly in turbulent gas. Starting with purely atomic hydrogen, large quantities of molecular hydrogen can be produced on timescales of 1 -- 2 Myr, given turbulent velocity dispersions and magnetic field strengths consistent with observations. Moreover, as our simulations underestimate the effectiveness of H2 self-shielding and dust absorption, we can be confident that the molecular fractions that we compute are strong lower limits on the true values. The formation of large quantities of H2 on the timescale required by rapid cloud formation models therefore appears to be entirely plausible.   We also investigate the density and temperature distributions of gas in our model clouds. We show that the density probability distribution function is approximately log-normal, with a dispersion that agrees well with the prediction of Padoan, Nordlund & Jones (1997). The temperature distribution is similar to that of a polytrope, with an effective polytropic index gamma_eff \simeq 0.8, although at low gas densities, the scatter of the actual gas temperature around this mean value is considerable, and the polytropic approximation does not capture the full range of behaviour of the gas.

"  This paper tries to contribute towards the solution of an important question raised in the SE literature: What is a Software Engineering (SE) specific theory? Which are the main features of a theory that is endemic to SE? In this paper we will use 'theory' as the term is used in traditional sciences. Other uses of the term 'theory' are discussed. Finally, we propose to focus on the reference class and on the structuring of SE theories as a basis for further progress. ",Reference and Structure of Software Engineering Theories
"  Ferroelectric and ferromagnetic materials possess spontaneous electric and magnetic order, respectively, which can be switched by the corresponding applied electric and magnetic fields. Multiferroics combine these properties in a single material, providing an avenue for controlling electric polarization with a magnetic field and magnetism with an electric field. These materials have been intensively studied in recent years, both for their fundamental scientific interest as well as their potential applications in a broad range of magnetoelectric devices [1, 2, 3, 4]. However, the microscopic origins of magnetism and ferroelectricity are quite different, and the mechanisms producing strong coupling between them are not always well understood. Hence, gaining a deeper understanding of magnetoelectric coupling in these materials is the key to their rational design. Here, we use ultrafast optical spectroscopy to show that quantum charge fluctuations can govern the interplay between electric polarization and magnetic ordering in the charge-ordered multiferroic LuFe2O4.

"  We present new millimeter and radio observations of nine z~6 quasars discovered in deep optical and near-infrared surveys. We observed the 250 GHz continuum in eight of the nine objects and detected three of them. New 1.4 GHz radio continuum data have been obtained for four sources, and one has been detected. We searched for molecular CO (6-5) line emission in the three 250 GHz detections and detected two of them. We study the FIR and radio emission and quasar-host galaxy evolution with a sample of 18 z~6 quasars that are faint at UV/optical wavelengths (rest-frame 1450A magnitudes of m_1450\ge20.2). The average FIR-to-AGN UV luminosity ratio of this faint quasar sample is about two times higher than that of the bright quasars at z~6 (m_1450<20.2). A fit to the average FIR and AGN bolometric luminosities of both the UV/optically faint and bright z~6 quasars, and the average luminosities of samples of submillimeter /millimeter-observed quasars at z~2 to 5, yields a relationship of L_{FIR} {L_{bol}}^{0.62}. Five of the 18 faint z~6 quasars have been detected at 250 GHz. These 250 GHz detections, as well as most of the millimeter-detected optically bright z~6 quasars, follow a shallower trend of L_{FIR} {L_{bol}}^{0.45} defined by the starburst-AGN systems in local and high-z universe. The millimeter continuum detections in the five objects and molecular CO detections in three of them reveal a few x10^8 M_sun of FIR-emitting warm dust and 10^10 M_sun of molecular gas in the quasar host galaxies. All these results argue for massive star formation in the quasar host galaxies, with estimated star formation rates of a few hundred M_sun yr^{-1}. Additionally, the higher FIR-to-AGN luminosity ratio found in these 250 GHz-detected faint quasars also suggests a higher ratio between star formation rate and supermassive black hole accretion rate than the UV/optically most luminous quasars at z~6.

"  The Hubbard model on a square lattice is one of the most studied condensed-matter quantum problems.Here we find evidence that for intermediate $U/4t$ values and a hole-concentration range $x\in (x_c,x_*)$ the ground state of the Hubbard model on the square lattice perturbed by weak three-dimensional (3D) uniaxial anisotropy has long-range d-wave superconducting order. Here $t$ is the effective nearest-neighbor transfer integral and $U$ the effective on-site repulsion. The lower critical concentration $x_c$ involves the Ginzburg number Gi and is approximately given by $x_c\approx {\rm Gi}+x_0\approx 0.05$. Here $x_0<{\rm Gi}$ is a small critical hole concentration that marks a sharp quantum phase transition from a Mott-Hubbard insulator with long-range antiferromagnetic order for $x<x_0$ to an Anderson insulator with short-range incommensurate spiral spin order for $x\in (x_0,x_c)$. The value of the critical hole concentration $x_*$ depends on $U/4t$ and is given by $x_*\approx 0.27$ for $U/4t\approx 1.525$. The long-range d-wave superconducting order emerges below a critical temperature $T_c$ for a hole concentration range centered at $x_{op}= (x_c+x_*)/2\approx 0.16$. It results from the effects of the residual interactions of the charge $c$ and spin-neutral two-spinon $s1$ fermions of Ref. \cite{companion2}, as a by-product of the short-range spin correlations. The spin subsystem provides through such interactions the energy needed for the effective pairing coupling between the $c$ fermions of the virtual-electron pair configurations.

"  We benchmark the 5000+ qubit system Advantage coupled with the Hybrid Solver Service 2 released by D-Wave Systems Inc. in September 2020 by using a new class of optimization problems called garden optimization problems known in companion planting. These problems are scalable to an arbitrarily large number of variables and intuitively find application in real-world scenarios. We derive their QUBO formulation and illustrate their relation to the quadratic assignment problem. We demonstrate that the Advantage system and the new hybrid solver can solve larger problems in less time than their predecessors. However, we also show that the solvers based on the 2000+ qubit system DW2000Q sometimes produce more favourable results if they can solve the problems.

"  We present novel statistical tools to cross-correlate frequency cleaned thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) maps and tomographic weak lensing (wl) convergence maps. Moving beyond the lowest order cross-correlation, we introduce a hierarchy of mixed higher-order statistics, the cumulants and cumulant correlators, to analyze non-Gaussianity in real space, as well as corresponding polyspectra in the harmonic domain. Using these moments, we derive analytical expressions for the joint two-point probability distribution function (2PDF) for smoothed tSZ (y_s) and convergence (\kappa_s) maps. The presence of tomographic information allows us to study the evolution of higher order {\em mixed} tSZ-weak lensing statistics with redshift. We express the joint PDFs p_{\kappa y}(\kappa_s,y_s) in terms of individual one-point PDFs (p_{\kappa}(\kappa_s), p_y(y_s)) and the relevant bias functions (b_{\kappa}(\kappa_s), b_y(y_s)). Analytical results for two different regimes are presented that correspond to the small and large angular smoothing scales. Results are also obtained for corresponding {\em hot spots} in the tSZ and convergence maps. In addition to results based on hierarchical techniques and perturbative methods, we present results of calculations based on the lognormal approximation. The analytical expressions derived here are generic and applicable to cross-correlation studies of arbitrary tracers of large scale structure including e.g. that of tSZ and soft X-ray background.

"  Recent progress in the spectroscopy of antiprotonic helium has allowed for measuring the separation between components of the hyperfine structure (HFS) of the (37,35) metastable states with an accuracy of 300 MHz, equivalent to a relative accuracy of 3x10^{-5}. The analysis of the uncertainties of the available theoretical results on the antiprotonic helium HFS shows that the accuracy of the value of the dipole magnetic moment of the antiproton (currently known to only 0.3 %) may be improved by up to 2 orders of magnitude by measuring the splitting of appropriately selected components of the HFS of any of the known metastable states. The feasibility of the proposed measurement by means of an analog of the triple resonance method is also discussed.

"  Reflecting the fundamental interactions of polarized light with magnetic matter, magneto-optical effects are well known since more than a century. The emergence of these phenomena is commonly attributed to the interplay between exchange splitting and spin-orbit coupling in the electronic structure of magnets. Using theoretical arguments, we demonstrate that topological magneto-optical effects can arise in noncoplanar antiferromagnets due to the finite scalar spin chirality, without any reference to exchange splitting or spin-orbit coupling. We propose spectral integrals of certain magneto-optical quantities that uncover the unique topological nature of the discovered effect. We also find that the Kerr and Faraday rotation angles can be quantized in insulating topological antiferromagnets in the low-frequency limit, owing to nontrivial global properties that manifest in quantum topological magneto-optical effects. Although the predicted topological and quantum topological magneto-optical effects are fundamentally distinct from conventional light-matter interactions, they can be measured by readily available experimental techniques.

"  After the previous work on gravitational frequency shift, light deflection (arXiv:1003.5296) and perihelion advance (arXiv:0812.2332), we calculate carefully the fourth gravity test, i.e. radar echo delay in a central gravity field surrounded by static free quintessence matter, in this paper. Through the Lagrangian method, we find the influence of the quintessence matter on the time delay of null particle is presence by means of an additional integral term. When the quintessence field vanishes, it reduces to the usual Schwarzschild case naturally. Meanwhile, we also use the data of the Viking lander from the Mars and Cassini spacecraft to Saturn to constrain the quintessence field. For the Viking case, the field parameter $\alpha$ is under the order of $10^{-9}$. However, $\alpha$ is under $10^{-18}$ for the Cassini case. ",The Fourth Gravity Test and Quintessence Matter Field
"  We consider the (gauged) Weyl gravity action, quadratic in the scalar curvature ($\tilde R$) and in the Weyl tensor ($\tilde C_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}$) of the Weyl conformal geometry. In the absence of matter fields, this action has spontaneous breaking in which the Weyl gauge field $\omega_\mu$ becomes massive (mass $m_\omega\sim$ Planck scale) after ""eating"" the dilaton in the $\tilde R^2$ term, in a Stueckelberg mechanism. As a result, one recovers the Einstein-Hilbert action with a positive cosmological constant and the Proca action for the massive Weyl gauge field $\omega_\mu$. Below $m_\omega$ this field decouples and Weyl geometry becomes Riemannian. The Einstein-Hilbert action is then just a ""low-energy"" limit of Weyl quadratic gravity which thus avoids its previous, long-held criticisms. In the presence of matter scalar field $\phi_1$ (Higgs-like), with couplings allowed by Weyl gauge symmetry, after its spontaneous breaking one obtains in addition, at low scales, a Higgs potential with spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking. This is induced by the non-minimal coupling $\xi_1\phi_1^2 \tilde R$ to Weyl geometry, with Higgs mass $\propto\xi_1/\xi_0$ ($\xi_0$ is the coefficient of the $\tilde R^2$ term). In realistic models $\xi_1$ must be classically tuned $\xi_1\ll \xi_0$. We comment on the quantum stability of this value.

We compute this joint distribution in the large $q$ limit. We also show that the ""large $q$, then large height"" limit of this distribution agrees with the one predicted by Bhargava-Kane-Lenstra-Poonen-Rains.

"  Many applications require charge neutralisation of isolated test bodies and this has been successfully done using photoelectric emission from surfaces which are electrically benign(gold) or superconducting (niobium). Gold surfaces nominally have a high work function ($\sim 5.1$\,eV)which should require deep UV photons for photoemission. In practice it has been found that it can be achieved with somewhat lower energy photons with indicative work functions of ($ 4.1-4.3$\,eV). A detailed working understanding of the process is lacking and this work reports on a study of the photoelectric emission properties of 4.6x4.6 cm^2 gold plated surfaces, representative of those used in typical satellite applications with a film thickness of 800 nm, and measured surface roughnesses between 7 and 340 nm. Various UV sources with photon energies from 4.8 to 6.2 eV and power outputs from 1 nW to 1000 nW, illuminated a ~0.3 cm^2 of the central surface region at angles of incidence from 0 to 60 degrees.   Final extrinsic quantum yields in the range 10 ppm to 44 ppm were reliably obtained during 8 campaigns, covering a ~3 year period, but with intermediate long-term variations lasting several weeks and, in some cases, bake-out procedures at up to 200 C. Experimental results were obtained in a vacuum system with a baseline pressure of ~10^{-7} mbar at room temperature. A working model, designed to allow accurate simulation of any experimental configuration, is proposed. ",Effective decrease of photoelectric emission threshold from gold plated   surfaces
"  Taken at a high spatial resolution of 0.1 arcsec, Bright Points (BPs) are found to coexist with faculae in images and the latter are often resolved as adjacent striations. Understanding the properties of these different features is fundamental to carrying out proxy magnetometry. To shed light on the relationship between BPs and faculae, we studied them separately after the application of a classification method, developed and described in a previous paper) on active region images at various heliocentric angles. In this Paper, we explore different aspects of the photometric properties of BPs and faculae, namely their G-band contrast profiles, their peak contrast in G-band and continuum, as well as morphological parameters. We find that: (1) the width of the contrast profiles of the classified BPs and faculae are consistent with studies of disk center BPs at and limb faculae, which indirectly confirms the validity of our classification, (2) the profiles of limb faculae are limbward skewed on average, while near disk center they exhibit both centerward and limbward skewnesses due to the distribution of orientations of the faculae, (3) the relation between the peak contrasts of BPs and faculae and their apparent area discloses a trend reminiscent of magnetogram studies. The skewness of facular profiles provides a novel constraint for 3D MHD models of faculae. As suggested by the asymmetry and orientation of their contrast profiles, faculae near disk center could be induced by inclined fields, while apparent BPs near the limb seem to be in fact small faculae misidentified. The apparent area of BPs and faculae could be possibly exploited for proxy magnetometry. ",Discriminant analysis of solar bright points and faculae II. Contrast   and morphology analysis
"  A term in the Maxwell-Ampere law describes a linear displacement current that is symmetrically enclosed by the curl of a magnetic field. In this context symmetry calls for a term in the Faraday-Lenz law, which in the absence of a conducting coil would describe a loop of displacement current about a linear increment of magnetic flux. This term, introduced to satisfy symmetry, predicts a physical phenomenon that has recently been observed. ",An Asymmetry in the Maxwell Equations
"  Previous single-particle spectroscopic studies of colloidal quantum dots have indicated a significant spread in biexciton lifetimes across an ensemble of nominally identical nanocrystals. It has been speculated that in addition to dot-to-dot variation in physical dimensions, this spread is contributed to by variations in the structure of the quantum dot interface, which controls the shape of the confinement potential. Here we directly evaluate the effect of the composition of the core-shell interface on single- and multi-exciton dynamics via side-by-side measurements of individual core-shell CdSe-CdS nanocrystals with a sharp vs. smooth (graded) interface. To realize the latter type of structures, we incorporate a CdSexS1-x alloy layer of controlled composition and thickness between the CdSe core and the CdS shell. We observe that while having essentially no effect on single-exciton decay, the interfacial alloy layer leads to a systematic increase in biexciton lifetimes. This observation provides direct experimental evidence that in addition to the size of the quantum dot, its interfacial properties also significantly affect the rate of Auger recombination, which governs biexciton decay. These findings help rationalize previous observations of a significant heterogeneity in the biexciton lifetimes across similarly sized quantum dots and should facilitate the development of Auger-recombination-free colloidal nanostructures for a range of applications from lasers and light-emitting diodes to photodetectors and solar cells.

"  We present a unified mathematical framework that elegantly describes minimally SUSY gauge theories in even dimension, ranging from $6d$ to $0d$, and their dualities. This approach combines recent developments on graded quiver with potentials, higher Ginzburg algebras and higher cluster categories (also known as $m$-cluster categories). Quiver mutations studied in the context of mathematics precisely correspond to the order $(m+1)$ dualities of the gauge theories. Our work suggests that these equivalences of quiver gauge theories sit inside an infinite family of such generalized dualities, whose physical interpretation is yet to be understood.

"  A local moment approach is developed for the single-particle excitations of a symmetric Anderson impurity model (AIM), with a soft-gap hybridization vanishing at the Fermi level with a power law r > 0. Local moments are introduced explicitly from the outset, and a two-self-energy description is employed in which the single-particle excitations are coupled dynamically to low-energy transverse spin fluctuations. The resultant theory is applicable on all energy scales, and captures both the spin-fluctuation regime of strong coupling (large-U), as well as the weak coupling regime. While the primary emphasis is on single particle dynamics, the quantum phase transition between strong coupling (SC) and (LM) phases can also be addressed directly; for the spin-fluctuation regime in particular a number of asymptotically exact results are thereby obtained. Results for both single-particle spectra and SC/LM phase boundaries are found to agree well with recent numerical renormalization group (NRG) studies. A number of further testable predictions are made; in particular, for r < 1/2, spectra characteristic of the SC state are predicted to exhibit an r-dependent universal scaling form as the SC/LM phase boundary is approached and the Kondo scale vanishes. Results for the `normal' r = 0 AIM are moreover recovered smoothly from the limit r -> 0, where the resultant description of single-particle dynamics includes recovery of Doniach-Sunjic tails in the Kondo resonance, as well as characteristic low-energy Fermi liquid behaviour.

"  The use of SU(3) chiral perturbation theory in the analysis of low energy meson-baryon interactions is discussed. It is emphasized that short distance effects, arising from propagation of Goldstone bosons over distances smaller than a typical hadronic size, are model-dependent and can lead to a lack of convergence in the SU(3) chiral expansion if they are included in loop diagrams. In this paper we demonstrate how to remove such effects in a chirally consistent fashion by use of a cutoff and demonstrate that such removal ameliorates problems which have arisen in previous calculations due to large loop effects.

"  Recent experimental results have confirmed a possible reduction in the GT$_+$ strengths of pf-shell nuclei. These proton-rich nuclei are of relevance in the deflagration and explosive burning phases of Type Ia supernovae. While prior GT strengths result in nucleosynthesis predictions with a lower-than-expected electron fraction, a reduction in the GT$_+$ strength can result in an slightly increased electron fraction compared to previous shell model predictions, though the enhancement is not as large as previous enhancements in going from rates computed by Fuller, Fowler, and Newman based on an independent particle model. A shell model parametrization has been developed which more closely matches experimental GT strengths. The resultant electron-capture rates are used in nucleosynthesis calculations for carbon deflagration and explosion phases of Type Ia supernovae, and the final mass fractions are compared to those obtained using more commonly-used rates.

We find significant deformation of the invariant-mass distributions of a gluino-pair near the mass threshold, as well as an additional correction to the total cross-section.

"  Motivated by models of fracture mechanics, this paper is devoted to the analysis of unilateral gradient flows of the Ambrosio-Tortorelli functional, where unilaterality comes from an irreversibility constraint on the fracture density. In the spirit of gradient flows in metric spaces, such evolutions are defined in terms of curves of maximal unilateral slope, and are constructed by means of implicit Euler schemes. An asymptotic analysis in the Mumford-Shah regime is also carried out. It shows the convergence towards a generalized heat equation outside a time increasing crack set.

"  Landau level lasers have the advantage of tunability of the laser frequency by means of the external magnetic field. The crucial prerequisite of such a laser is a population inversion between optically coupled Landau levels. Efficient carrier-carrier and carrier-phonon scattering generally suppresses this effect in conventional materials. Based on microscopic calculations, we predict for the first time the occurrence of a long-lived population inversion in Landau-quantized graphene and reveal the underlying many-particle mechanisms. To guide the experimental demonstration, we present optimal conditions for the observation of a maximal population inversion in terms of experimentally accessible parameters, such as the strength of the magnetic field, pump fluence, temperature, and doping. We reveal that in addition to the tunability of the Landau-level laser frequency, also the polarization of the emitted light can be tuned via gate voltage controlling the doping of the sample.

"  Box score statistics in the National Basketball Association are used to measure and evaluate player performance. Some of these statistics are subjective in nature and since box score statistics are recorded by scorekeepers hired by the home team for each game, there exists potential for inconsistency and bias. These inconsistencies can have far reaching consequences, particularly with the rise in popularity of daily fantasy sports. Using box score data, we estimate models able to quantify both the bias and the generosity of each scorekeeper for two of the most subjective statistics: assists and blocks. We then use optical player tracking data for the 2014-2015 season to improve the assist model by including other contextual spatio-temporal variables such as time of possession, player locations, and distance traveled. From this model, we present results measuring the impact of the scorekeeper and of the other contextual variables on the probability of a pass being recorded as an assist. Results for adjusting season assist totals to remove scorekeeper influence are also presented. ",Adjusting for Scorekeeper Bias in NBA Box Scores
"  The electronic nematic phase emerging with spontaneous rotation symmetry breaking is a central issue of modern condensed matter physics. In particular, various nematic phases in iron-based superconductors and high-$T_{\rm c}$ cuprate superconductors are extensively studied recently. Electric quadrupole moments (EQMs) are one of the order parameters characterizing these nematic phases in a unified way, and elucidating EQMs is a key to understanding these nematic phases. However, the quantum-mechanical formulation of the EQMs in crystals is a nontrivial issue because the position operators are non-periodic and unbound. Recently, the EQMs have been formulated by local thermodynamics, and such {\it thermodynamic EQMs} may be used to characterize the fourfold rotation symmetry breaking in materials. In this paper, we calculate the thermodynamic EQMs in iron-based superconductors LaFeAsO and FeSe as well as a cuprate superconductor La$_2$CuO$_4$ by a first-principles calculation. We show that owing to the orbital degeneracy the EQMs in iron-based superconductors are mainly determined by the geometric properties of wave functions. This result is in sharp contrast to the cuprate superconductor, in which the EQMs are dominated by distortion of the Fermi surface.

In this case the phenomenon of gelation occurs and solutions lose mass at some finite time. The problem of the existence of self-similar solutions involves a free parameter $b$, and one expects that a physically relevant solution (i.e. nonnegative and with sufficiently fast decay at infinity) exists for a single value of $b$, depending on the homogeneity $\gamma$. We prove this picture rigorously for large values of $\gamma$. In the general case, we discuss in detail the behaviour of solutions to the self-similar equation as the parameter $b$ changes.

We discuss the effects of different treatment of some quantities in other pulsation hydrocodes. Our most important finding concerns the treatment of the turbulent source function in convectively stable regions. In our code we allow for negative values of source function in convectively stable zones, which reflects negative buoyancy. However, some authors restrict the source term to non-negative values. We show that this assumption leads to very high turbulent energies in convectively stable regions. The effect looks like overshooting, but it is not, because turbulence is generated by pulsations. Also, turbulent elements do not carry kinetic nor thermal energy, into convectively stable layers. The range of this artificial overshooting (as we shall call it) is as large as 6 local pressure scale heights, leading to unphysical internal damping through the eddy-viscous forces, in deep, convectively stable parts of the star.

"  We investigate the relationship between environment and the galaxy main sequence (the relationship between stellar mass and star formation rate) and also the relationship between environment and radio luminosity (P$_{\rm 1.4GHz}$) to shed new light on the effects of the environments on galaxies. We use the VLA-COSMOS 3 GHz catalogue that consists of star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and quiescent galaxies (AGN) in three different environments (field, filament, cluster) and for three different galaxy types (satellite, central, isolated). We perform for the first time a comparative analysis of the distribution of SFGs with respect to the main sequence (MS) consensus region from the literature, taking into account galaxy environment and using radio observations at 0.1 $\leq$ z $\leq$ 1.2. Our results corroborate that SFR is declining with cosmic time which is consistent with the literature. We find that the slope of the MS for different $z$ and M$_{*}$ bins is shallower than the MS consensus with a gradual evolution towards higher redshift bins, irrespective of environments. We see no SFR trends on both environments and galaxy type given the large errors. In addition, we note that the environment does not seem to be the cause of the flattening of MS at high stellar masses for our sample.

"  To illustrate the campaign to extend our knowledge of the charmonium spectrum, I focus on a puzzling new state, $X(3872) \to \pi^+\pi^- J/\psi$. Studying the influence of open-charm channels on charmonium properties leads us to propose a new charmonium spectroscopy: additional discrete charmonium levels that can be discovered as narrow resonances of charmed and anticharmed mesons. I call attention to open issues for theory and experiment. ",The Lost Tribes of Charmonium
"  Neural Networks (NNs) are vulnerable to adversarial examples. Such inputs differ only slightly from their benign counterparts yet provoke misclassifications of the attacked NNs. The required perturbations to craft the examples are often negligible and even human imperceptible. To protect deep learning-based systems from such attacks, several countermeasures have been proposed with adversarial training still being considered the most effective. Here, NNs are iteratively retrained using adversarial examples forming a computational expensive and time consuming process often leading to a performance decrease. To overcome the downsides of adversarial training while still providing a high level of security, we present a new training approach we call \textit{entropic retraining}. Based on an information-theoretic-inspired analysis, entropic retraining mimics the effects of adversarial training without the need of the laborious generation of adversarial examples. We empirically show that entropic retraining leads to a significant increase in NNs' security and robustness while only relying on the given original data. With our prototype implementation we validate and show the effectiveness of our approach for various NN architectures and data sets. ",Optimizing Information Loss Towards Robust Neural Networks
"  We study Artin kernels, i.e. kernels of discrete characters of right-angled Artin groups, and we show that they decompose as graphs of groups in a way that can be explicitly computed from the underlying graph. When the underlying graph is chordal we show that every such subgroup either surjects to an infinitely generated free group or is a generalized Baumslag-Solitar group of variable rank. In particular for block graphs (e.g. trees), we obtain an explicit rank formula, and discuss some features of the space of fibrations of the associated right-angled Artin group.

"  We consider a nonlocal isoperimetric problem defined in the whole space $\R^N$, whose nonlocal part is given by a Riesz potential with exponent $\alpha\in(0, N-1)$. We show that critical configurations with positive second variation are local minimizers and satisfy a quantitative inequality with respect to the $L^1$-norm. This criterion provides the existence of a (explicitly determined) critical threshold determining the interval of volumes for which the ball is a local minimizer, and allows to address several global minimality issues.

"  Some significant quantities in mathematics and physics are most naturally expressed as the Fredholm determinant of an integral operator, most notably many of the distribution functions in random matrix theory. Though their numerical values are of interest, there is no systematic numerical treatment of Fredholm determinants to be found in the literature. Instead, the few numerical evaluations that are available rely on eigenfunction expansions of the operator, if expressible in terms of special functions, or on alternative, numerically more straightforwardly accessible analytic expressions, e.g., in terms of Painleve transcendents, that have masterfully been derived in some cases. In this paper we close the gap in the literature by studying projection methods and, above all, a simple, easily implementable, general method for the numerical evaluation of Fredholm determinants that is derived from the classical Nystrom method for the solution of Fredholm equations of the second kind. Using Gauss-Legendre or Clenshaw-Curtis as the underlying quadrature rule, we prove that the approximation error essentially behaves like the quadrature error for the sections of the kernel. In particular, we get exponential convergence for analytic kernels, which are typical in random matrix theory. The application of the method to the distribution functions of the Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE), in the bulk and the edge scaling limit, is discussed in detail. After extending the method to systems of integral operators, we evaluate the two-point correlation functions of the more recently studied Airy and Airy1 processes for the first time.

"  It is a common narrative that blockchains are immutable and so it is technically impossible to erase data stored on them. For legal and ethical reasons, however, individuals and organizations might be compelled to erase locally stored data, be it encoded on a blockchain or not. The common assumption for blockchain networks like Bitcoin is that forcing nodes to erase data contained on the blockchain is equal to permanently restricting them from participating in the system in a full-node role. Challenging this belief, in this paper, we propose and demonstrate a pragmatic approach towards functionality-preserving local erasure (FPLE). FPLE enables full nodes to erase infringing or undesirable data while continuing to store and validate most of the blockchain. We describe a general FPLE approach for UTXO-based (i.e., Bitcoin-like) cryptocurrencies and present a lightweight proof-of-concept tool for safely erasing transaction data from the local storage of Bitcoin Core nodes. Erasing nodes continue to operate in tune with the network even when erased transaction outputs become relevant for validating subsequent blocks. Using only our basic proof-of-concept implementation, we are already able to safely comply with a significantly larger range of erasure requests than, to the best of our knowledge, any other full node operator so far.

"  We improve the current bounds for an inequality of Erd\H{o}s and Tur\'an from 1950 related to the discrepancy of angular equidistribution of the zeros of a given polynomial. Building upon a recent work of Soundararajan, we establish a novel connection between this inequality and an extremal problem in Fourier analysis involving the maxima of Hilbert transforms, for which we provide a complete solution. Prior to Soundararajan (2019), refinements of the discrepancy inequality of Erd\H{o}s and Tur\'an had been obtained by Ganelius (1954) and Mignotte (1992).

"  Transaction Repair is a method for lock-free, scalable transaction processing that achieves full serializability. It demonstrates parallel speedup even in inimical scenarios where all pairs of transactions have significant read-write conflicts. In the transaction repair approach, each transaction runs in complete isolation in a branch of the database; when conflicts occur, we detect and repair them. These repairs are performed efficiently in parallel, and the net effect is that of serial processing. Within transactions, we use no locks. This frees users from the complications and performance hazards of locks, and from the anomalies of sub-SERIALIZABLE isolation levels. Our approach builds on an incrementalized variant of leapfrog triejoin, a worst-case optimal algorithm for $\exists_1$ formulae, and on well-established techniques from programming languages: declarative languages, purely functional data structures, incremental computation, and fixpoint equations.

"  We consider conformal and 't Hooft anomalies in six-dimensional ${\cal N}=(1,0)$ superconformal field theories, focusing on those conformal anomalies that determine the two- and three-point functions of conserved flavor and $SU(2)_R$ currents, as well as stress tensors. By analyzing these correlators in superspace, we explain why the number of independent conformal anomalies is reduced in supersymmetric theories. For instance, non-supersymmetric CFTs in six dimensions have three independent conformal $c$-anomalies, which determine the stress-tensor two- and three-point functions, but in superconformal theories the three $c$-anomalies are subject to a linear constraint. We also describe anomaly multiplet relations, which express the conformal anomalies of a superconformal theory in terms of its 't Hooft anomalies. Following earlier work on the conformal $a$-anomaly, we argue for these relations by considering the supersymmetric dilaton effective action on the tensor branch of such a theory. We illustrate the utility of these anomaly multiplet relations by presenting exact results for conformal anomalies, and hence current and stress-tensor correlators, in several interacting examples.

We prove that (r-1)n < IR(H, Sn) < (r-1)(r-1)n + cn, for any c>0, sufficiently large n, and r denoting the chromatic number of H. The lower bound is asymptotically tight for any fixed bipartite H.

"  Using multiple tracers of large-scale structure allows to evade the limitations imposed by sampling variance for some parameters of interest in cosmology. We demonstrate the optimal way of carrying out a multitracer analysis in a galaxy redshift survey by considering the principal components of the shot noise matrix from two-point clustering statistics. We show how to construct two tracers that maximize the benefits of sampling variance and shot noise cancellation using optimal weights. On the basis of high-resolution N-body simulations of dark matter halos we apply this technique to the analysis of redshift-space distortions and demonstrate how constraints on the growth rate of structure formation can be substantially improved. The primary limitation are nonlinear effects, which cause significant biases in the method already at scales of k<0.1h/Mpc, suggesting the need to develop nonlinear models of redshift-space distortions in order to extract the maximum information from future redshift surveys. Nonetheless we find gains of a factor of a few in constraints on the growth rate achievable when merely the linear regime of a galaxy survey like EUCLID is considered.

"  The new spectropolarimetric spectra of HD157087 obtained recently with ESPaDOnS at CFHT are analysed to verify the nature of this object. The fundamental stellar parameters $T_{\rm eff}$ = 8882 K, $\log{g}$=3.57 have been obtained for HD157087 from the analysis of nine Balmer line profiles in two available spectra. Comparison of the results of our abundance analysis with the previously published data shows a variability of average abundance with time for some chemical species, while the abundance of other elements remains almost the same. The abundance analysis also reveals evidence of a significant abundance increase towards the deeper atmospheric layers for C, S, Ca, Sc, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni and Zr. Together with the found enhanced abundance of Ca and Sc this fact contradicts the classification of HD157087 as a marginal Am star. Analysis of the available measurements of radial velocity results in detection of long periodic and short periodic variations. The long periodic variation supports the idea that HD157087 is an astrometric binary system with a period higher than 6 years. The presence of short periodic variation of $V_{\rm r}$, as well as the detection of temporal variation of average abundance suggest that HD157087 may be a triple system, where a short periodic binary rotates around a third star. In this case, the short periodic binary may consist of slowly rotating Am and A (or Ap with weak magnetic field) stars that have similar effective temperature and surface gravity, but different abundance peculiarities.

"  We present a systematic downfolding many-body approach for extended systems. Many-body calculations operate on a simpler Hamiltonian which retains material-specific properties. The Hamiltonian is systematically improvable and allows one to dial, in principle, between the simplest model and the original Hamiltonian. As a by-product, pseudopotential errors are essentially eliminated using a frozen-core treatment. The computational cost of the many-body calculation is dramatically reduced without sacrificing accuracy. We use the auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) method to solve the downfolded Hamiltonian. Excellent accuracy is achieved for a range of solids, including semiconductors, ionic insulators, and metals. We further test the method by determining the spin gap in NiO, a challenging prototypical material with strong electron correlation effects. This approach greatly extends the reach of general, ab initio many-body calculations in materials. ",Quantum Monte Carlo calculations in solids with downfolded Hamiltonians
"  Federated learning (FL) enables distributed computation of machine learning models over various disparate, remote data sources, without requiring to transfer any individual data to a centralized location. This results in an improved generalizability of models and efficient scaling of computation as more sources and larger datasets are added to the federation. Nevertheless, recent membership attacks show that private or sensitive personal data can sometimes be leaked or inferred when model parameters or summary statistics are shared with a central site, requiring improved security solutions. In this work, we propose a framework for secure FL using fully-homomorphic encryption (FHE). Specifically, we use the CKKS construction, an approximate, floating point compatible scheme that benefits from ciphertext packing and rescaling. In our evaluation on large-scale brain MRI datasets, we use our proposed secure FL framework to train a deep learning model to predict a person's age from distributed MRI scans, a common benchmarking task, and demonstrate that there is no degradation in the learning performance between the encrypted and non-encrypted federated models.

"  We consider the existence and spectral stability of periodic multi-pulse solutions in Hamiltonian systems which are translation invariant and reversible, for which the fifth-order Korteweg-de Vries equation is a prototypical example. We use Lin's method to construct multi-pulses on a periodic domain, and in particular demonstrate a pitchfork bifurcation structure for periodic double pulses. We also use Lin's method to reduce the spectral problem for periodic multi-pulses to computing the determinant of a block matrix, which encodes both eigenvalues resulting from interactions between neighboring pulses and eigenvalues associated with the essential spectrum. We then use this matrix to compute the spectrum associated with periodic single and double pulses. Most notably, we prove that brief instability bubbles form when eigenvalues collide on the imaginary axis as the periodic domain size is altered. These analytical results are all in good agreement with numerical computations. ",Periodic multi-pulses and spectral stability in Hamiltonian PDEs with   symmetry
"  The magnetic and ferroelectric properties of the multiferroic system Mn$_{1-x}$Co$_x$WO$_4$ (x=0.135, 0.15, and 0.17) are studied in magnetic fields $H_c$ oriented along the monoclinic $c$-axis. Mn$_{0.85}$Co$_{0.15}$WO$_4$, which is right at the phase boundary between two helical spin structures, exhibits a spontaneous sign change of the ferroelectric polarization when cooled in fields $H_c>$ 25 kOe. The origin of the ferroelectric polarization is studied and two magnetic exchange interactions contributing to the polarization are identified. In Mn$_{0.85}$Co$_{0.15}$WO$_4$ domains of the characteristic helical spin structures, known for x$<$0.15 and x$>$0.15, coexist and form domain boundaries. The contributions of the different domains to the global polarization are determined. The polarization reversal in Mn$_{0.85}$Co$_{0.15}$WO$_4$ can be explained by a combination of various contributions to the polarization and a strong correlation between magnetic domains of different helical spin orders resulting in a smooth transition across the domain walls which preserves the chirality of the spin spiral.

"  It is well-known that the appearance of almost-empty (shallow) conduction bands in solids strongly affects their superconducting properties. In a shallow band charge carriers are depleted and have nearly zero velocities so that the crossover from the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) superfluidity to Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) is approached. Based on a two-band prototype system with one shallow and one deep band, we demonstrate that the fundamental phase diagram of the superconducting magnetic response changes qualitatively as compared to standard superconductors with only deep bands. The so-called intertype (IT) domain between superconductivity types I and II systematically expands in the phase diagram when passing from the BCS to BEC side: its width is inversely proportional to the squared Cooper-pair radius that shrinks several orders of magnitude through the crossover. We also show that the coupling to a stable condensate of the deep band makes the system rather robust against the otherwise strong superconducting fluctuations. Thus, the BCS-BEC crossover induced by a shallow band pushes standard superconductivity types wide apart so that the IT domain tends to dominate the phase diagram and therefore the magnetic properties of shallow-band superconductors.

"  We present a unified large system analysis of linear receivers for a class of random matrix channels. The technique unifies the analysis of both the minimum-mean-squared-error (MMSE) receiver and the adaptive least-squares (ALS) receiver, and also uses a common approach for both random i.i.d. and random orthogonal precoding. We derive expressions for the asymptotic signal-to-interference-plus-noise (SINR) of the MMSE receiver, and both the transient and steady-state SINR of the ALS receiver, trained using either i.i.d. data sequences or orthogonal training sequences. The results are in terms of key system parameters, and allow for arbitrary distributions of the power of each of the data streams and the eigenvalues of the channel correlation matrix. In the case of the ALS receiver, we allow a diagonal loading constant and an arbitrary data windowing function. For i.i.d. training sequences and no diagonal loading, we give a fundamental relationship between the transient/steady-state SINR of the ALS and the MMSE receivers. We demonstrate that for a particular ratio of receive to transmit dimensions and window shape, all channels which have the same MMSE SINR have an identical transient ALS SINR response. We demonstrate several applications of the results, including an optimization of information throughput with respect to training sequence length in coded block transmission.

Internal component describes the change of the base pair position in the double helix. External component describes the displacement of mass center of the monomer link. Nonlinearity of the system is accounted with a form of potential energy describing C3'-C2' and C2'-C3' sugars transitions in monomer link, and interrelation between monomer conformational transition and macromolecule deformation. The comparison of our results with experimental data allows to confirm that the localized conformational excitations may realise in DNA TATA-box.

II) Only the thermodynamics of C-doping phases appears to be marginally competing in enthalpy against H$_3$S. III) Accurate results of the transition temperature given by ab initio Migdal-Eliashberg calculations differ by more than 110 K to recently theoretical claims explaining the high-temperature superconductivity in carbonaceous-hydrogen sulfide.

"  Tomography medical imaging is essential in the clinical workflow of modern cancer radiotherapy. Radiation oncologists identify cancerous tissues, applying delineation on treatment regions throughout all image slices. This kind of task is often formulated as a volumetric segmentation task by means of 3D convolutional networks with considerable computational cost. Instead, inspired by the treating methodology of considering meaningful information across slices, we used Gated Graph Neural Network to frame this problem more efficiently. More specifically, we propose convolutional recurrent Gated Graph Propagator (GGP) to propagate high-level information through image slices, with learnable adjacency weighted matrix. Furthermore, as physicians often investigate a few specific slices to refine their decision, we model this slice-wise interaction procedure to further improve our segmentation result. This can be set by editing any slice effortlessly as updating predictions of other slices using GGP. To evaluate our method, we collect an Esophageal Cancer Radiotherapy Target Treatment Contouring dataset of 81 patients which includes tomography images with radiotherapy target. On this dataset, our convolutional graph network produces state-of-the-art results and outperforms the baselines. With the addition of interactive setting, performance is improved even further.

The space parameter for the model is explored and the corresponding spectral energy distributions (SEDs) are presented. We conclude that secondary leptonic emission represents a significant though hardly dominant contribution to the total radio emission in MQs, with observational consequences that can be used to test some still unknown processes occurring in these objects as well as the nature of the matter outflowing in their jets.

"  We introduce and analyze several aspects of a new model for cell differentiation. It assumes that differentiation of progenitor cells is a continuous process. From the mathematical point of view, it is based on partial differential equations of transport type. Specifically, it consists of a structured population equation with a nonlinear feedback loop. This models the signaling process due to cytokines, which regulate the differentiation and proliferation process. We compare the continuous model to its discrete counterpart, a multi-compartmental model of a discrete collection of cell subpopulations recently proposed by Marciniak-Czochra et al. in 2009 to investigate the dynamics of the hematopoietic system. We obtain uniform bounds for the solutions, characterize steady state solutions, and analyze their linearized stability. We show how persistence or extinction might occur according to values of parameters that characterize the stem cells self-renewal. We also perform numerical simulations and discuss the qualitative behavior of the continuous model vis a vis the discrete one. ",A Structured Population Model of Cell Differentiation
"  Portfolio optimisation typically aims to provide an optimal allocation that minimises risk, at a given return target, by diversifying over different investments. However, the potential scope of such risk diversification can be limited if investments are concentrated in only one country, or more specifically one currency. Multi-currency portfolio is an alternative to achieve higher returns and more diversified portfolios but it requires a careful management of the entailed risks from changes in exchange rates.   The deviation between asset and currency exposures in a portfolio is defined as the ""currency overlay"". This paper addresses risk mitigation by allowing currency overlay and asset allocation be optimised together. We propose a model of the international portfolio optimisation problem in which the currency overlay is constructed by holding foreign exchange rate forward contracts. Crucially, the cost of carry, transaction costs, and margin requirement of forward contracts are also taken into account in portfolio return calculation. This novel extension of previous overlay models improves the accuracy of risk and return calculation of portfolios; furthermore, our experimental results show that inclusion of such costs significantly changes the optimal decisions. Effects of constraints imposed to reduce transaction costs associated are examined and the empirical results show that risk-return compensation of portfolios varies significantly with different return targets.

"  Isomorphs are curves in the phase diagram along which both structure and dynamics to a good approximation are invariant. There are two main methods to trace out isomorphs in both atomic and molecular systems, the configurational adiabat method and the direct isomorph check method. We introduce and test a new family of force based methods on three molecular models; the asymmetric dumbbell model, the symmetric inverse power law dumbbell model, and the Lewis-Wahnstr\""{o}m model of o-terphenyl. A unique feature of the force based methods is that they only require a single configuration to trace out an isomorph. The atomic force method was previously shown to work very well for the Kob-Andersen binary Lennard-Jones mixture, but we show that it does not work for molecular models. In contrast, we find that a new method based on molecular forces works well for all three molecular models ",Predicting scaling properties of fluids from individual configurations:   Small molecules

"  Human-robot interaction can be divided into two categories based on the physical distance between the human and robot: remote and proximal. In proximal interaction, the human and robot often engage in close coordination; in remote interaction, the human and robot are less coupled due to communication constraints. As a result, providing automation for the robot in remote interaction becomes more important. Thus far, human factor studies on automation in remote human-robot interaction have been restricted to various forms of supervision, in which the robot is essentially being used as a smart mobile manipulation platform with sensing capabilities. In this paper, we investigate the incorporation of general planning capability into the robot to facilitate peer-to-peer human-robot teaming, in which the human and robot are viewed as teammates that are physically separated. The human and robot share the same global goal and collaborate to achieve it. Note that humans may feel uncomfortable at such robot autonomy, which can potentially reduce teaming performance. One important difference between peer-to-peer teaming and supervised teaming is that an autonomous robot in peer-to-peer teaming can achieve the goal alone when the task information is completely specified. However, incompleteness often exists, which implies information asymmetry. While information asymmetry can be desirable sometimes, it may also lead to the robot choosing improper actions that negatively influence the teaming performance. We aim to investigate the various trade-offs, e.g., mental workload and situation awareness, between these two types of remote human-robot teaming.

In analogy with the cotangent complex we introduce the so called (derived) Hochschild complex of a morphism; the Hochschild cohomology and homology groups are then the Ext and Tor groups of that complex. We prove that these objects are well defined, extend the known cases, and have the expected functorial and homological properties such as graded commutativity of Hochschild cohomology and existence of the characteristic homomorphism from Hochschild cohomology to the (graded) centre of the derived category.

"  CLEAN algorithms are a class of deconvolution solvers which are widely used to remove the effect of the telescope Point Spread Function (PSF). Loop gain is one important parameter in CLEAN algorithms. Currently the parameter is fixed during deconvolution, which restricts the performance of CLEAN algorithms. In this paper, we propose a new deconvolution algorithm with an adaptive loop gain scheme, which is referred to as the adaptive-loop-gain adaptivescale CLEAN (Algas-Clean) algorithm. The test results show that the new algorithm can give a more accurate model with faster convergence. ",The adaptive-loop-gain adaptive-scale CLEAN deconvolution of radio   interferometric images
"  We explore the idea of a network of defects to live inside a domain wall in models of three real scalar fields, engendering the Z_2 x Z_3 symmetry. The field that governs the Z_2 symmetry generates a domain wall, and entraps the hexagonal network formed by the three-junctions of the model of two scalar fields that describes the remaining Z_3 symmetry. If the host domain wall bends to the spherical form, in the thin wall approximation there may appear non-topological structures hosting networks that accept diverse patterns. If Z_3 is also broken, the model may generate a buckyball containing sixty junctions, a fullerene-like structure. Applications to cosmology are outlined. ",Entrapment of a Network of Domain Walls

"  The visual and audio information from movies can evoke a variety of emotions in viewers. Towards a better understanding of viewer impact, we present our methods for the MediaEval 2018 Emotional Impact of Movies Task to predict the expected valence and arousal continuously in movies. This task, using the LIRIS-ACCEDE dataset, enables researchers to compare different approaches for predicting viewer impact from movies. Our approach leverages image, audio, and face based features computed using pre-trained neural networks. These features were computed over time and modeled using a gated recurrent unit (GRU) based network followed by a mixture of experts model to compute multiclass predictions. We smoothed these predictions using a Butterworth filter for our final result. Our method enabled us to achieve top performance in three evaluation metrics in the MediaEval 2018 task.

"  Primordial black holes as a viable candidate of cold dark matter are clustering in the large-scale structures of the Universe. The stochastic gravitational-wave background, arising from an incoherent superposition of unresolved gravitational waves from primordial black hole binaries, is expected to display anisotropies across the sky. In this work, we obtain the angular power spectrum for such anisotropies for the first time and the difference between it and the one from astrophysical black hole binaries. When multi-band measurements are employed, the angular power spectrum can be a smoking gun for the existence of primordial black holes, in particular those of stellar masses that otherwise are challenging to be distinguished from the astrophysical black holes.

  The dependence of K+ production on the nuclear equation of state is investigated in heavy ion collisions. An increase of the excitation function of K+ multiplicities obtained in heavy (Au+Au) over light (C+C) systems when going far below threshold which has been observed by the KaoS Collaboration strongly favours a soft equation of state. This observation holds despite of the influence of an in-medium kaon potential predicted by effective chiral models which is necessary to reproduce the experimental K+ yields. Phase space effects are discussed with respect to the K+ excitation function. ,The nuclear equation of state probed by K+ production in heavy ion   collisions
"  Superconductivity can be realized in Eu-containing pnictides by application of chemical (internal) and physical (external) pressure, the intrinsic physical mechanism of which attracts much attention in physics community. Here we present the experimental evidence for the valence change of europium in compounds of EuFe2As1.4P0.6 exposed to ambient pressure and EuFe2As2 to high pressure by x-ray absorption measurements on L3-Eu edge. We find that the absorption spectrum of EuFe2As1.4P0.6 at ambient pressure shows clear spectra weight transfer from a divalent to a trivalent state. Furthermore, application of pressure on EuFe2As2 using a diamond anvil cell shows a similar behavior of valence transition as EuFe2As1.4P0.6. These findings are the first observation of superconductivity mechanized by valence change in pnictides superconductors and elucidate the intrinsic physical origin of superconductivity in EuFe2As1.4P0.6 and compressed EuFe2As2.

"  This paper presents a study of dc photocurrents in biased insulators to the third order in the electric field. We find three photocurrents which are characterized by physical divergences of the third-order free-electron polarization susceptibility. In the absence of momentum relaxation and saturation effects, these dc photocurrents grow as $t^n$ $(n=2,1,0)$ with illumination time. The photocurrents are dubbed \textit{jerk}, third-order injection, and third-order shift current, respectively, and are generalizations of the second-order injection and shift currents of the bulk photovoltaic effect. We also revisit the theory of the bulk photovoltaic effect and include Fermi surface contributions which are important in metals. Finally, we show that injection, shift, and jerk currents admit simple physical interpretations in terms of semiclassical wave packet dynamics in electric fields. Experimental signatures and extensions to higher-order susceptibilities are also discussed. ",Bulk photovoltaic effects in the presence of a static electric field
"  Machine learning methods such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are becoming an integral part of scientific research in many disciplines, spatial vector data often fail to be analyzed using these powerful learning methods because of its irregularities. With the aid of graph Fourier transform and convolution theorem, it is possible to convert the convolution as a point-wise product in Fourier domain and construct a learning architecture of CNN on graph for the analysis task of irregular spatial data. In this study, we used the classification task of building patterns as a case study to test this method, and experiments showed that this method has achieved outstanding results in identifying regular and irregular patterns, and has significantly improved in comparing with other methods.

"  A 3.56-hour white dwarf (WD) - M dwarf (MD) close binary system, AR Scorpii, was recently reported to show pulsating emission in radio, IR, optical, and UV, with a 1.97-minute period, which suggests the existence of a WD with a rotation period of 1.95 minutes. We propose a model to explain the temporal and spectral characteristics of the system. The WD is a nearly perpendicular rotator, with both open field line beams sweeping the MD stellar wind periodically. A bow shock propagating into the stellar wind accelerates electrons in the wind. Synchrotron radiation of these shocked electrons can naturally account for the broad-band (from radio to X-rays) spectral energy distribution of the system. ",A Model of White Dwarf Pulsar AR Scorpii

"  The influence of the gravity acceleration on the regularized energy-momentum tensor of the quantized electromagnetic field between two plane parallel conducting plates is derived. We use Fermi coordinates and work to first order in the constant acceleration parameter. A perturbative expansion, to this order, of the Green functions involved and of the energy-momentum tensor is derived by means of the covariant geodesic point splitting procedure. In correspondence to the Green functions satisfying mixed and gauge-invariant boundary conditions, and Ward identities, the energy-momentum tensor is covariantly conserved and satisfies the expected relation between gauge-breaking and ghost parts. A more systematic derivation is therefore obtained of the theoretical prediction according to which the Casimir device in a weak gravitational field will experience a tiny push in the upwards direction.

"  The recent discovery of pressure induced superconductivity in the binary helimagnet CrAs has attracted much attention. How superconductivity emerges from the magnetic state and what is the mechanism of the superconducting pairing are two important issues which need to be resolved. In the present work, the suppression of magnetism and the occurrence of superconductivity in CrAs as a function of pressure ($p$) were studied by means of muon spin rotation. The magnetism remains bulk up to $p\simeq3.5$~kbar while its volume fraction gradually decreases with increasing pressure until it vanishes at $p\simeq$7~kbar. At 3.5 kbar superconductivity abruptly appears with its maximum $T_c \simeq 1.2$~K which decreases upon increasing the pressure. In the intermediate pressure region ($3.5\lesssim p\lesssim 7$~kbar) the superconducting and the magnetic volume fractions are spatially phase separated and compete for phase volume. Our results indicate that the less conductive magnetic phase provides additional carriers (doping) to the superconducting parts of the CrAs sample thus leading to an increase of the transition temperature ($T_c$) and of the superfluid density ($\rho_s$). A scaling of $\rho_s$ with $T_c^{3.2}$ as well as the phase separation between magnetism and superconductivity point to a conventional mechanism of the Cooper-pairing in CrAs.

"  A major issue in the development of the technology of nitride based materials is the choice of substrate. The structural and optical properties of the layers are intimately connected to the substrate material used in the epitaxial growth. Key issues include lattice matching of substrate and epitaxial layer and the difference in the thermal expansion between the substrate and epitaxial layer. Due to the extremely high vapor pressure of nitrogen over Gallium Nitride (GaN), pure GaN substrate are very difficult to produce and currently almost all nitride-based device are fabricated by hetero-epitaxy on either Sapphire or Silicon Carbide (SiC). Alternatively, AlN has a significantly lower vapor pressure of nitrogen and can be grown in bulk form. In this paper we report on our results in the growth of AlN by physical vapor transport. A theoretical model was developed to investigate the growth process by to determine optimal growth parameters. Several different seed crystals were investigated, singular 6H-SiC, 3.50 off-axis 6H-SiC and 80 off-axis 4H-SiC, and AlN grown by hydride vapor deposition on silicon substrates (the silicon substrates were subsequently removed by etching).

"  We define the direct sum of a countable family of pointed metric spaces in a way resembling the direct sum of groups. Then we prove that if a family consists of $0$-hyperbolic (in the sense of Gromov) and $D$-discrete spaces, then its direct sum has asymptotic property C. The main example is a countable direct sum of free groups of (possibly varying) finite rank. This is a generalization of T. Yamauchi's result concernig the countable direct sum of the integers.

"  The polarization process of polar codes over a ternary alphabet is studied. Recently it has been shown that the scaling of the blocklength of polar codes with prime alphabet size scales polynomially with respect to the inverse of the gap between code rate and channel capacity. However, except for the binary case, the degree of the polynomial in the bound is extremely large. In this work, it is shown that a much lower degree polynomial can be computed numerically for the ternary case. Similar results are conjectured for the general case of prime alphabet size.

"  In a weak measurement with post-selection, a measurement value, called the weak value, can be amplified beyond the eigenvalues of the observable. However, there are some controversies whether the weak value amplification is practically useful or not in increasing sensitivity of the measurement in which fundamental quantum noise dominates. In this paper, we investigate the sensitivity limit of an optical interferometer by properly taking account quantum shot noise and radiation pressure noise. To do so, we formulate the weak value amplification in the Heisenberg picture, which enables us to intuitively understand what happens when the measurement outcome is post-selected and the weak value is amplified. As a result, we found that the sensitivity limit is given by the standard quantum limit that is the same as in a standard interferometry. We also discuss a way to circumvent the standard quantum limit. ",Weak value amplification and beyond the standard quantum limit in   position measurements

"  We introduce and study a log discrepancy function on the space of semivaluations centered on an integral noetherian scheme of positive characteristic. Our definition shares many properties with the analogue in characteristic zero; we prove that if log resolutions exist, then our definition agrees with previous approaches to log discrepancies of semivaluations that these resolutions. We then apply this log discrepancy to a variety of topics in singularity theory over fields of positive characteristic. Strong F-regularity and sharp $F$-purity of Cartier subalgebras are detected using positivity and non-negativity of log discrepancies of semivaluations, just as Kawamata log terminal and log canonical singularities are defined using divisorial log discrepancies, making precise a long-standing heuristic. We prove, in positive characteristic, several theorems of Jonsson and Mustata in characteristic zero regarding log canonical thresholds of graded sequences of ideals. Along the way, we give a valuation-theoretic proof that asymptotic multiplier ideals are coherent on strongly F-regular schemes. ",Berkovich log discrepancies in positive characteristic
"  We have discovered rapid Quasi Periodic Oscillations (QPOs) in RXTE/PCA measurements of the pulsating tail of the 27th December 2004 giant flare of SGR 1806-20. QPOs at about 92.5Hz are detected in a 50s interval starting 170s after the onset of the giant flare. These QPOs appear to be associated with increased emission by a relatively hard unpulsed component and are seen only over phases of the 7.56s spin period pulsations away from the main peak. QPOs at about 18 and 30Hz are also detected, 200-300s after the onset of the giant flare. This is the first time that QPOs are unambiguously detected in the flux of a Soft Gamma-ray Repeater, or any other magnetar candidate. We interpret the highest QPOs in terms of the coupling of toroidal seismic modes with Alfven waves propagating along magnetospheric field lines. The lowest frequency QPO might instead provide indirect evidence on the strength of the internal magnetic field of the neutron star.

"  Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a leading cause of death worldwide. Rapid diagnosis and initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is the cornerstone of therapy for victims of cardiac arrest. Yet a significant fraction of cardiac arrest victims have no chance of survival because they experience an unwitnessed event, often in the privacy of their own homes. An under-appreciated diagnostic element of cardiac arrest is the presence of agonal breathing, an audible biomarker and brainstem reflex that arises in the setting of severe hypoxia. Here, we demonstrate that a support vector machine (SVM) can classify agonal breathing instances in real-time within a bedroom environment. Using real-world labeled 9-1-1 audio of cardiac arrests, we train the SVM to accurately classify agonal breathing instances. We obtain an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.998 and an operating point with an overall sensitivity and specificity of 97.03% (95% CI: 96.62 -- 97.41%) and 98.20% (95% CI: 97.87 -- 98.49%). We achieve a false positive rate between 0% -- 0.10% over 82 hours (117,895 audio segments) of polysomnographic sleep lab data that includes snoring, hypopnea, central and obstructive sleep apnea events. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our contactless system in identifying real-world cardiac arrest-associated agonal breathing instances and successfully evaluate our classifier using commodity smart devices (Amazon Echo and Apple iPhone).

"  With the aim of deriving symmetric hyperbolic free-evolution systems for GR that possess Hamiltonian structure and allow for the popular puncture gauge condition we analyze the hyperbolicity of Hamiltonian systems. We develop helpful tools which are applicable to either the first order in time, second order in space or the fully second order form of the equations of motion. For toy models we find that the Hamiltonian structure can simplify the proof of symmetric hyperbolicity. In GR we use a special structure of the principal part to prove symmetric hyperbolicity of a formulation that includes gauge conditions which are very similar to the puncture gauge.

"  We have carried out the first systematic survey of the sub-millimeter properties of broad absorption line (BAL) quasars. 30 BAL quasars drawn from a homogeneously selected sample from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey at redshifts 2<z<2.6 were observed with the SCUBA array at the JCMT to a typical rms sensitivity of 2.5 mJy. Eight quasars were detected at > 2 sigma significance, four of which are at > 3 sigma significance. The far-infrared luminosities of these quasars are > 10^{13} L_solar. There is no correlation of sub-millimeter flux with either the strength of the broad absorption feature or with absolute magnitude in our sample. We compare the sub-millimeter flux distribution of the BAL quasar sample with that of a sample of quasars which do not show BAL features in their optical spectra and find that the two are indistinguishable. BAL quasars do not have higher sub-millimeter luminosities than non-BAL quasars. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that all quasars would contain a BAL if viewed along a certain line-of-sight. The data are inconsistent with a model in which the BAL phenomenon indicates a special evolutionary stage which co-incides with a large dust mass in the host galaxy and a high sub-millimeter luminosity. Our work provides constraints on alternative evolutionary explanations of BAL quasars. ",The sub-millimeter properties of broad absorption line quasars
"  While regular flat bands are good for enhancing the density of states and hence the gap, they are detrimental to the superfluid weight. We show that the predicted nontrivial topology of the two lowest flat bands of twisted bilayer graphene plays an important role in the enhancement of the superfluid weight and hence of superconductivity. We derive the superfluid weight (phase stiffness) of the TBLG superconducting flat bands with a uniform pairing, and show that it can be expressed as an integral of the Fubini-Study metric of the flat bands. This mirrors results already obtained for nonzero Chern number bands even though the TBLG flat bands have zero Chern number. We further show the metric integral is lower bounded by the topological $C_{2z}T$ Wilson loop winding number of the TBLG flat bands, which renders the superfluid weight has a topological lower bound proportional to the pairing gap. In contrast, trivial flat bands have a zero superfluid weight. The superfluid weight is crucial in determining the BKT transition temperature of the superconductor. Based on the transition temperature measured in TBLG experiments, we estimate the topological contribution of the superfluid weight in TBLG.

"  We present quantum algorithms to search for marked vertices in structured databases with low connectivity. Adopting a multi-stage search process, we achieve a success probability close to $100\%$ on Cayley trees with large branching factors. We find that the number of stages required is given by the height of the Cayley tree. At each stage, the jumping rate should be chosen as different values. The dominant term of the runtime in the search process is proportional to $N^{(2r-1)/2r}$ for the Cayley tree of height $r$ with $N$ vertices. We further find that one can control the number of stages by adjusting the weight of the edges in the graphs. The multi-stage search process can be merged into a single stage, and then an optimal runtime proportional to $\sqrt{N}$ is achieved, yielding a substantial speedup. The search process is quite robust under various kinds of small perturbations. ",Controlled quantum search on structured databases

For the zero-mode, we can construct a random lattice fermion without a doubling and quite large systems ( up to $801 \times 801$) are treated numerically.

"  We compare results of exact calculations of single parton scattering (SPS) and double parton scattering (DPS) for production of $c \bar c c \bar c$ and for $D$ meson correlations. The SPS calculations are performed in collinear approximation with exact matrix element for $g g \to c \bar c c \bar c$ and $q \bar q \to c \bar c c \bar c$ subprocesses. It is shown that the contribution of gluon-gluon subprocess is about factor 50 larger than that for quark-antiquark annihilation. The new results are compared with results of previous calculation with the approximate matrix element for $g g \to c \bar c c \bar c$ in the high-energy approximation.

We compare correlations in rapidities of two $c$ (or two $\bar c$) for DPS and SPS contributions. Finally we compare our predictions for $D$ mesons with recent results of the LHCb collaboration for invariant mass, rapidity distance between mesons and dimeson invariant mass.

"  Thermodynamics constrains the flow of matter in a reaction network to occur through routes along which the Gibbs energy decreases, implying that viable steady-state flux patterns should be void of closed reaction cycles. Identifying and removing cycles in large reaction networks can unfortunately be a highly challenging task from a computational viewpoint. We propose here a method that accomplishes it by combining a relaxation algorithm and a Monte Carlo procedure to detect loops, with ad hoc rules (discussed in detail) to eliminate them. As test cases, we tackle (a) the problem of identifying infeasible cycles in the E. coli metabolic network and (b) the problem of correcting thermodynamic infeasibilities in the Flux-Balance-Analysis solutions for 15 human cell-type specific metabolic networks. Results for (a) are compared with previous analyses of the same issue, while results for (b) are weighed against alternative methods to retrieve thermodynamically viable flux patterns based on minimizing specific global quantities. Our method on one hand outperforms previous techniques and, on the other, corrects loopy solutions to Flux Balance Analysis. As a byproduct, it also turns out to be able to reveal possible inconsistencies in model reconstructions.

"  Signed directed social networks, in which the relationships between users can be either positive (indicating relations such as trust) or negative (indicating relations such as distrust), are increasingly common. Thus the interplay between positive and negative relationships in such networks has become an important research topic. Most recent investigations focus upon edge sign inference using structural balance theory or social status theory. Neither of these two theories, however, can explain an observed edge sign well when the two nodes connected by this edge do not share a common neighbor (e.g., common friend). In this paper we develop a novel approach to handle this situation by applying a new model for node types. Initially, we analyze the local node structure in a fully observed signed directed network, inferring underlying node types. The sign of an edge between two nodes must be consistent with their types; this explains edge signs well even when there are no common neighbors. We show, moreover, that our approach can be extended to incorporate directed triads, when they exist, just as in models based upon structural balance or social status theory. We compute Bayesian node types within empirical studies based upon partially observed Wikipedia, Slashdot, and Epinions networks in which the largest network (Epinions) has 119K nodes and 841K edges. Our approach yields better performance than state-of-the-art approaches for these three signed directed networks. ",A Model of Consistent Node Types in Signed Directed Social Networks
"  The dependence of the electrical conductivity on the oxygen partial pressure is calculated for the prototypical perovskite $\Ba\Ti\O_3$ based on data obtained from first-principles calculations within density functional theory. The equilibrium point defect concentrations are obtained via a self-consistent determination of the electron chemical potential. This allows to derive charge carrier concentrations for a given temperature and chemical environment and eventually the electrial conductivity. The calculations are in excellent agreement with experimental data if an accidental acceptor dopant level of $10^{17}\,\cm^{-3}$ is assumed. It is shown that doubly charged oxygen vacancies are accountable for the high-temperature $n$-type conduction under oxygen-poor conditions. The high-temperature $p$-type conduction observed at large oxygen pressures is due to barium vacancies and titanium-oxygen di-vacancies under Ti and Ba-rich conditions, respectively. Finally, the connection between the present approach and the mass-action law approach to point defect thermodynamics is discussed.

"  We investigate the tilting and warping of galactic disks in response to tidal torquing. The strength of the torque is determined from cosmological N-body simulations. We find the tidal torques to be dominated by substructure in the galactic halo, such as dwarf satellites, and by a misalignment between the disk angular momentum and the figure axes of the dark matter halo. The radial dependence of the torque can approximated by a power law of index -2.5. A massless disk subjected to such a torque develops a trailing warp similar to those seen in a large number of disk galaxies, i.e. the inner regions of the disk tilt faster than the outer disk. In the case of massive disks, self gravity causes the inner disk to stay locally flat and only the outer regions show the signatures of warps. The radius outside of which a massive disk is warped depends on the local surface density of the disk and on the product of the strength of the torque and the exposure time to this torque.

"  This paper deals with solutions of the nonlinear Boltzmann equation for spatially uniform freely cooling inelastic Maxwell models for large times and for large velocities, and the nonuniform convergence to these limits. We demonstrate how the velocity distribution approaches in the scaling limit to a similarity solution with a power law tail for general classes of initial conditions and derive a transcendental equation from which the exponents in the tails can be calculated. Moreover on the basis of the available analytic and numerical results for inelastic hard spheres and inelastic Maxwell models we formulate a conjecture on the approach of the velocity distribution function to a scaling form.

We study a class of two-dimensional topologically trivial superconductors without chiral edge modes, which nevertheless host robust Majorana zero modes in topological defects. The construction of this minimal single-band model is facilitated by the Hopf map and the Hopf invariant. This work will stimulate investigations of Majorana zero modes in superconductors in the topologically trivial regime.

"  In the literature, the notion of discrepancy is used in several contexts, even in the theory of graphs. Here, for a graph $G$, $\{-1, 1\}$ labels are assigned to the edges, and we consider a family $\mathcal{S}_G$ of (spanning) subgraphs of certain types, among others spanning trees, Hamiltonian cycles. As usual, we seek for bounds on the sum of the labels that hold for all elements of $\mathcal{S}_G$, for every labeling. ",On the discrepancies of graphs
"  The exploitation of the CoRoT treasure of stars observed in the exoplanetary field allowed the detection of a unusual triple-mode Cepheid in the Milky Way, CoRoT 0223989566. The two modes with the largest amplitudes and period ratio of 0.80 are identified with the first (P1=1.29 d) and second (P2=1.03 d) radial overtones. The third period, which has the smallest amplitude but able to produce combination terms with the other two, is the longest one (P3=1.89 d). The ratio of 0.68 between the first-overtone period and the third period is the unusual feature. Its identification with the fundamental radial or a nonradial mode is discussed with respect to similar cases in the Magellanic Clouds. In both cases the period triplet and the respective ratios make the star unique in our Galaxy. The distance derived from the period-luminosity relation and the galactic coordinates put CoRoT~0223989566 in the metal-rich environment of the ""outer arm"" of the Milky Way.

"  We review the dramatic progress in the simulations of compact objects and compact-object binaries that has taken place in the first two decades of the twenty-first century. This includes simulations of the inspirals and violent mergers of binaries containing black holes and neutron stars, as well as simulations of black-hole formation through failed supernovae and high-mass neutron star--neutron star mergers. Modeling such events requires numerical integration of the field equations of general relativity in three spatial dimensions, coupled, in the case of neutron-star containing binaries, with increasingly sophisticated treatment of fluids, electromagnetic fields, and neutrino radiation. However, it was not until 2005 that accurate long-term evolutions of binaries containing black holes were even possible. Since then, there has been an explosion of new results and insights into the physics of strongly-gravitating system. Particular emphasis has been placed on understanding the gravitational wave and electromagnetic signatures from these extreme events. And with the recent dramatic discoveries of gravitational waves from merging black holes by the Laser Interferometric Gravitational Wave Observatory and Virgo, and the subsequent discovery of both electromagnetic and gravitational wave signals from a merging neutron star binary, numerical relativity became an indispensable tool for the new field of multimessenger astronomy.

"  We present a comprehensive analysis of coherence properties of the radiation from X-ray free electron laser (XFEL). We consider practically important case when XFEL is optimized for maximum gain. Such an optimization allows to reduce significantly parameter space. Application of similarity techniques to the results of numerical simulations allows to present all output characteristics of the optimized XFEL as functions of the only parameter, ratio of the emittance to the radiation wavelength, $ \hat{\epsilon} = 2\pi \epsilon/\lambda $. Our studies show that optimum performance of the XFEL in terms of transverse coherence is achieved at the value of the parameter $\hat{\epsilon}$ of about unity. At smaller values of $\hat{\epsilon}$ the degree of transverse coherence is reduced due to strong influence of poor longitudinal coherence on a transverse one. At large values of the emittance the degree of transverse coherence degrades due to poor mode selection. Comparative analysis of existing XFEL projects, European XFEL, LCLS, and SCSS is presented as well. ",Coherence properties of the radiation from X-ray free electron laser
"  The problem of the mean-square optimal estimation of the linear functionals which depend on the unknown values of a stochastic stationary sequence from observations of the sequence in special sets of points is considered. Formulas for calculating the mean-square error and the spectral characteristic of the optimal linear estimate of the functionals are derived under the condition of spectral certainty, where the spectral density of the sequence is exactly known. The minimax (robust) method of estimation is applied in the case where the spectral density of the sequence is not known exactly while some sets of admissible spectral densities are given. Formulas that determine the least favourable spectral densities and the minimax spectral characteristics are derived for some special sets of admissible densities.

"  We investigate the velocity-correlation distributions after $n$ collisions of a tagged particle undergoing binary collisions. Analytical expressions are obtained in any dimension for the velocity-correlation distribution after the first-collision as well as for the velocity-correlation function after an infinite number of collisions, in the limit of Gaussian velocity distributions. It appears that the decay of the first-collision velocity-correlation distribution for negative argument is exponential in any dimension with a coefficient that depends on the mass and on the coefficient of restitution. We also obtained the velocity-correlation distribution when the velocity distributions are not Gaussian: by inserting Sonine corrections of the velocity distributions, we derive the corrections to the velocity-correlation distribution which agree perfectly with a DSMC (Direct Simulation Monte Carlo) simulation. We emphasize that these new quantities can be easily obtained in simulations and likely in experiments: they could be an efficient probe of the local environment and of the degree of inelasticity of the collisions.

"  Saturn's B ring is the most opaque ring in our solar system, but many of its fundamental parameters, including its total mass, are not well constrained. Spiral density waves generated by mean-motion resonances with Saturn's moons provide some of the best constraints on the rings' mass density, but detecting and quantifying such waves in the B ring has been challenging because of this ring's high opacity and abundant fine-scale structure. Using a wavelet-based analyses of 17 occultations of the star gamma Crucis observed by the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) onboard the Cassini spacecraft, we are able to examine five density waves in the B ring. Two of these waves are generated by the Janus 2:1 and Mimas 5:2 Inner Lindblad Resonances at 96,427 km and 101,311 km from Saturn's center, respectively. Both of these waves can be detected in individual occultation profiles, but the multi-profile wavelet analysis reveals unexpected variations in the pattern speed of the Janus 2:1 wave that might arise from the periodic changes in Janus' orbit. The other three wave signatures are associated with the Janus 3:2, Enceladus 3:1 and Pandora 3:2 Inner Lindblad Resonances at 115,959 km, 115,207 km and 108,546 km. These waves are not visible in individual profiles, but structures with the correct pattern speeds can be detected in appropriately phase-corrected average wavelets. Estimates of the ring's surface mass density derived from these five waves fall between 40 and 140 g/cm^2, even though the ring's optical depth in these regions ranges from 1.5 to almost 5. This suggests that the total mass of the B ring is most likely between one-third and two-thirds the mass of Saturn's moon Mimas.

"  We study ultraslow diffusion processes with logarithmic mean squared displacement (MSD) $\langle x^2(t)\rangle\simeq\log^{\gamma}t$. Comparison of annealed continuous time random walks (CTRWs) with logarithmic waiting time distribution $\psi(\tau)\simeq1/(\tau\log^{1+\gamma}\tau)$ and Sinai diffusion in quenched random landscapes shows striking similarities, despite their very different physical nature. In particular, they exhibit a weakly non-ergodic disparity of the time and ensemble averaged MSDs. Remarkably, for the CTRW we observe that the fluctuations of time averages become universal with an exponential suppression of mobile trajectories. We discuss the fundamental connection between the Golosov localization effect and non-ergodicity in the sense of the disparity between ensemble and time averaged MSD.

"  The slip transfer phenomenon was studied at the grain boundaries of pure Aluminum by means of slip trace analysis. Either slip transfer or blocked slip was analyzed in more than 250 grain boundaries and the likelihood of slip transfer between two slip systems across the boundary was assessed. The experimental results indicate that slip transfer was very likely to occur if the residual Burgers vector, $\Delta$b, was below 0.35b and the Luster- Morris parameter was higher than 0.9, and that the ratio of the Luster-Morris parameter and the residual Burgers vector has a threshold above which slip transfer is probable.

"  A preference order or ranking aggregated from pairwise comparison data is commonly understood as a strict total order. However, in real-world scenarios, some items are intrinsically ambiguous in comparisons, which may very well be an inherent uncertainty of the data. In this case, the conventional total order ranking can not capture such uncertainty with mere global ranking or utility scores. In this paper, we are specifically interested in the recent surge in crowdsourcing applications to predict partial but more accurate (i.e., making less incorrect statements) orders rather than complete ones. To do so, we propose a novel framework to learn some probabilistic models of partial orders as a \emph{margin-based Maximum Likelihood Estimate} (MLE) method. We prove that the induced MLE is a joint convex optimization problem with respect to all the parameters, including the global ranking scores and margin parameter. Moreover, three kinds of generalized linear models are studied, including the basic uniform model, Bradley-Terry model, and Thurstone-Mosteller model, equipped with some theoretical analysis on FDR and Power control for the proposed methods. The validity of these models are supported by experiments with both simulated and real-world datasets, which shows that the proposed models exhibit improvements compared with traditional state-of-the-art algorithms.

  We report the analysis in the wavevector space of the density correlator of a Lennard Jones binary mixture confined in a disordered matrix of soft spheres upon supercooling. In spite of the strong confining medium the behavior of the mixture is consistent with the Mode Coupling Theory predictions for bulk supercooled liquids. The relaxation times extracted from the fit of the density correlator to the stretched exponential function follow a unique power law behavior as a function of wavevector and temperature. The von Schweidler scaling properties are valid for an extended wavevector range around the peak of the structure factor. The parameters extracted in the present work are compared with the bulk values obtained in literature. ,Slow dynamics of a confined supercooled binary mixture II: Q space   analysis
"  We consider QCD t\bar{t}\gamma and t\bar{t}Z production at hadron colliders as a tool to measure the tt\gamma and ttZ couplings. At the Tevatron it may be possible to perform a first, albeit not very precise, test of the tt\gamma vector and axial vector couplings in t\bar{t}\gamma production, provided that more than 5 fb^{-1} of integrated luminosity are accumulated. The t\bar{t}Z cross section at the Tevatron is too small to be observable. At the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) it will be possible to probe the tt\gamma couplings at the few percent level, which approaches the precision which one hopes to achieve with a next-generation e^+e^- linear collider. The LHC's capability of associated QCD t\bar{t}V (V=\gamma, Z) production has the added advantage that the tt\gamma and ttZ couplings are not entangled. For an integrated luminosity of 300 fb^{-1}, the ttZ vector (axial vector) coupling can be determined with an uncertainty of 45-85% (15-20%), whereas the dimension-five dipole form factors can be measured with a precision of 50-55%. The achievable limits improve typically by a factor of 2-3 for the luminosity-upgraded (3 ab^{-1}) LHC. ",Probing Electroweak Top Quark Couplings at Hadron Colliders
"  This work introduces a complexity measure which addresses some conflicting issues between existing ones by using a new principle - measuring the average amount of symmetry broken by an object. It attributes low (although different) complexity to either deterministic or random homogeneous densities and higher complexity to the intermediate cases. This new measure is easily computable, breaks the coarse graining paradigm and can be straightforwardly generalised, including to continuous cases and general networks. By applying this measure to a series of objects, it is shown that it can be consistently used for both small scale structures with exact symmetry breaking and large scale patterns, for which, differently from similar measures, it consistently discriminates between repetitive patterns, random configurations and self-similar structures.

"  An intelligent reflecting surface (IRS), consisting of reconfigurable metamaterials, can be used to partially control the radio environment and thereby bring new features to wireless communications. Previous works on IRS have particularly studied the range extension use case and under what circumstances the new technology can beat relays. In this paper, we study another use case that might have a larger impact on the channel capacity: rank improvement. One of the classical bottlenecks of point-to-point MIMO communications is that the capacity gains provided by spatial multiplexing are only large at high SNR, and high SNR channels are mainly appearing in line-of-sight (LoS) scenarios where the channel matrix has low rank and therefore does not support spatial multiplexing. We demonstrate how an IRS can be used and optimized in such scenarios to increase the rank of the channel matrix, leading to substantial capacity gains.

"  $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological insulators for photons and in general bosons cannot be strictly implemented because of the lack of symmetry-protected pseudospins. We show that the required protection can be provided by the real-space topological excitation of an interacting quantum fluid: quantum vortex. We consider a Bose-Einstein Condensate at the $\Gamma$ point of the Brillouin zone of a quantum valley Hall system based on two staggered honeycomb lattices. We demonstrate the existence of a coupling between the winding number of a vortex and the valley of the bulk Bloch band. This leads to chiral vortex propagation at the zigzag interface between two regions of inverted staggering, where the winding-valley coupling provides true topological protection against backscattering, contrary to the interface states of the non-interacting Hamiltonian. This configuration is an analog of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological insulator for quantum vortices. ",$\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological insulator analog for vortices in an   interacting bosonic quantum fluid

"  The D0 Collaboration has recently seen a resonant-like peak in the $B_s\pi$ invariant mass spectrum, claimed to be a new state called $X(5568)$. Using a $B_s\pi$--$B\bar{K}$ coupled channel analysis, implementing unitarity, and with the interaction derived from Heavy Meson Chiral Perturbation Theory, we are able to reproduce the reported spectrum, with a pole that can be associated to the claimed $X(5568)$ state, and with mass and width in agreement with the ones reported in the experimental analysis. However, if the $T$-matrix regularization is performed by means of a momentum cutoff, the value for the latter needed to reproduce the spectrum is $\Lambda = 2.80 \pm 0.04\ \text{GeV}$, much larger than a ""natural"" value $\Lambda \simeq 1\ \text{GeV}$. In view of this, it is difficult to interpret the nature of this new state. This state would not qualify as a resonance dynamically generated by the unitarity loops. Assuming the observed peak to correspond to a physical state, we make predictions for partners in the $D$, $D^\ast$, and $B^\ast$ sectors. Their observation (or lack thereof) would shed light into this issue. ","Can $X(5568)$ be described as a $B_s\pi$, $B\bar{K}$ resonant state?"

"  We study the equilibrium shapes of vesicles, with an in-plane nematic order, using a Monte-Carlo scheme and show that highly curved shapes, like tubes and discs, with a striking similarity to the structures engendered by certain curvature sensing peripheral membrane proteins, can be spontaneously generated by anisotropic directional curvature with nematic disclinations playing and important role. We show that the coupling between nematic order and local curvature could lead to like defects moving towards each other and unlike defects moving away, in turn leading to tube formation. Thermally induced defect pair production lead to branched tubular structures. It is also shown that helical arrangement of the membrane tubes, with nematic field spiraling around it, is a dominant soft mode of the system.

"  We consider the magnetorotational instability (MRI) of a hydrodynamically stable Taylor-Couette flow with a helical external magnetic field in the inductionless approximation defined by a zero magnetic Prandtl number ($\Pm=0)$. This leads to a considerable simplification of the problem eventually containing only hydrodynamic variables. First, we point out that the energy of any perturbation growing in the presence of magnetic field has to grow faster without the field. This is a paradox because the base flow is stable without the magnetic while it is unstable in the presence of a helical magnetic field without being modified by the latter as it has been found recently by Hollerbach and Rudiger [Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 124501 (2005)]. We revisit this problem by using a Chebyshev collocation method to calculate the eigenvalue spectrum of the linearized problem. In this way, we confirm that MRI with helical magnetic field indeed works in the inductionless limit where the destabilization effect appears as an effective shift of the Rayleigh line. Second, we integrate the linearized equations in time to study the transient behavior of small amplitude perturbations, thus showing that the energy arguments are correct as well. However, there is no real contradiction between both facts. The linear stability theory predicts the asymptotic development of an arbitrary small-amplitude perturbation, while the energy stability theory yields the instant growth rate of any particular perturbation, but it does not account for the evolution of this perturbation.

"  Due to the relevance for conservation biology, there is an increasing interest to extend evolutionary genomics models to plant, animal or microbial species. However, this requires to understand the effect of life-history traits absent in humans on genomic evolution. In this context, it is fundamentally of interest to generalize the replicator equation, which is at the heart of most population genomics models. However, as the inclusion of life-history traits generates models with a large state space, the analysis becomes involving. We focus, here, on quiescence and seed banks, two features common to many plant, invertebrate and microbial species. We develop a method to obtain a low-dimensional replicator equation in the context of evolutionary game theory, based on two assumptions: (1) the life-history traits are {\it per se} neutral, and (2) frequency-dependent selection is weak. We use the results to investigate the evolution and maintenance of cooperation based on the Prisoner's dilemma. We first consider the generalized replicator equation, and then refine the investigation using adaptive dynamics. It turns out that, depending on the structure and timing of the quiescence/dormancy life-history trait, cooperation in a homogeneous population can be stabilized. We finally discuss and highlight the relevance of these results for plant, invertebrate and microbial communities. ",Life-History traits and the replicator equation

For several classes of tree, and for both uniform and Gaussian vertex frequency distributions, we provide tight closed form bounds and empirical expressions for the expected value of the critical coupling. We also provide several bounds on the expected value of the critical coupling for all trees. Finally, we show that for a given set of vertex frequencies, there is a rearrangement of oscillator frequencies for which the critical coupling is bounded by the spread of frequencies.

"  We numerically analyse the behavior of the full distribution of collective observables in quantum spin chains. While most of previous studies of quantum critical phenomena are limited to the first moments, here we demonstrate how quantum fluctuations at criticality lead to highly non-Gaussian distributions thus violating the central limit theorem.

We also calculate the entropy production associated with the time-dependent self-assembly process and examine how it can be used to predict conditions under which the external time-varying signal is reliably encoded as a spatial pattern in the self-assembling material. While the results in this work are developed in the context of a minimal one-dimensional model, we anticipate that the framework can be used to establish guidelines for controlling self-assembly in more complex scenarios.

"  In this paper, we propose a discontinuous distributed model-independent algorithm for a directed network of Euler-Lagrange agents to track the trajectory of a leader with non-constant velocity. We initially study a fixed network and show that the leader tracking objective is achieved semi-globally exponentially fast if the graph contains a directed spanning tree. By model-independent, we mean that each agent executes its algorithm with no knowledge of the parameter values of any agent's dynamics. Certain bounds on the agent dynamics (including any disturbances) and network topology information are used to design the control gain. This fact, combined with the algorithm's model-independence, results in robustness to disturbances and modelling uncertainties. Next, a continuous approximation of the algorithm is proposed, which achieves practical tracking with an adjustable tracking error. Last, we show that the algorithm is stable for networks that switch with an explicitly computable dwell time. Numerical simulations are given to show the algorithm's effectiveness.

"  The Steiner distance in a graph, introduced by Chartrand et al. in 1989, is a natural generalization of the concept of classical graph distance. For a connected graph $G$ of order at least 2 and $S\subseteq V(G)$, the Steiner distance $d_G(S)$ of the set $S$ of vertices in $G$ is the minimum size of a connected subgraph whose vertex set contains or connects $S$. In this paper, we introduce the concept of the Steiner (revised) Szeged index ($rSz_k(G)$) $Sz_k(G)$ of a graph $G$, which is a natural generalization of the well-known (revised) Szeged index of chemical use. We determine the $Sz_k(G)$ for trees in general. Then we give a formula for computing the Steiner Szeged index of a graph in terms of orbits of automorphism group action on the edge set of the graph. Finally, we give sharp upper and lower bounds of ($rSz_k(G)$) $Sz_k(G)$ of a connected graph $G$, and establish some of its properties.

We compared the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of FeSiO$_3$ PPv-II with experimental results of the recently reported H-phase of (Fe,Mg)SiO$_3$. The intensities and positions of two main X-ray diffraction peaks of PPv-II FeSiO$_3$ compare well with those of the H-phase. We also calculated the static equation of state, the enthalpy and the bulk modulus of the PPv-II phase and compared it with those of perovskite (Pv) and post-perovskite (PPv) phases of FeSiO$_3$. According to the static DFT+U computations the PPv-II phase of FeSiO$_3$ is less stable than Pv and PPv phases under lower mantle pressure conditions at 0 K and has a higher volume. PPv-II may be entropically stabilized, and may be a stable phase in Earth$'$s lower mantle, coexisting with $\alpha$-PbO$_2$ (Columbite-structured) silica and perovskite, or with magnesiowustite or ferropericlase, depending on bulk composition.

"  The purpose of this paper is to develop the theory of holomorphic gerbes on complex tori in a manner analogous to the classical theory for line bundles. In contrast to past studies on this subject, we do not restrict to the case where these gerbes are torsion or topologically trivial. We give an Appell-Humbert type description of all holomorphic gerbes on complex tori. This gives an explicit, simple, cocycle representative (and hence gerbe) for each equivalence class of holomorphic gerbes. We also prove that a gerbe on the fiber product of four spaces over a common base is trivial as long as it is trivial upon restriction to any three out of the four spaces. A fine moduli stack for gerbes on complex tori is constructed. This involves the construction of a 'Poincar\'e' gerbe which plays a role analogous to the role of the Poincar\'e bundle in the case of line bundles.

"  We consider the estimation of the average treatment effect in the treated as a function of baseline covariates, where there is a valid (conditional) instrument.   We describe two doubly robust (DR) estimators: a locally efficient g-estimator, and a targeted minimum loss-based estimator (TMLE). These two DR estimators can be viewed as generalisations of the two-stage least squares (TSLS) method to semi-parametric models that make weaker assumptions. We exploit recent theoretical results that extend to the g-estimator the use of data-adaptive fits for the nuisance parameters.   A simulation study is used to compare standard TSLS with the two DR estimators' finite-sample performance, (1) when fitted using parametric nuisance models, and (2) using data-adaptive nuisance fits, obtained from the Super Learner, an ensemble machine learning method.   Data-adaptive DR estimators have lower bias and improved coverage, when compared to incorrectly specified parametric DR estimators and TSLS. When the parametric model for the treatment effect curve is correctly specified, the g-estimator outperforms all others, but when this model is misspecified, TMLE performs best, while TSLS can result in large biases and zero coverage.   Finally, we illustrate the methods by reanalysing the COPERS (COping with persistent Pain, Effectiveness Research in Self-management) trial to make inference about the causal effect of treatment actually received, and the extent to which this is modified by depression at baseline.

"  We determine the local metallicity of the ionized gas for more than $9.2\times 10^5$ star forming regions (spaxels) located in 1023 nearby galaxies included in the SDSS-IV MaNGA IFU survey. We use the dust extinction derived from the Balmer decrement and stellar template fitting in each spaxel to estimate the local gas and stellar mass densities, respectively. We also use the measured rotation curves to determine the local escape velocity ($\mathrm{V_{esc}}$). We have then analyze the relationships between the local metallicity and both the local gas fraction ($\mu$) and $\mathrm{V_{esc}}$. We find that metallicity decreases with both increasing $\mu$ and decreasing $\mathrm{V_{esc}}$. By examining the residuals in these relations we show that the gas fraction plays a more primary role in the local chemical enrichment than $\mathrm{V_{esc}}$. We show that the gas-regulator model of chemical evolution provides a reasonable explanation of the metallicity on local scales. The best-fit parameters for this model are consistent with metal loss caused by momentum-driven galactic outflows. We also argue that both the gas fraction and local escape velocity are connected to the local stellar surface density, which in turn is a tracer of the epoch at which the dominant local stellar population formed ",SDSS-IV MaNGA: What Shapes The Distribution Of Metals In Galaxies?

"  The phase diagram of cuprate high-temperature superconductors features an enigmatic pseudogap region that is characterized by a partial suppression of low energy electronic excitations. Polarized neutron diffraction, Nernst effect, THz polarimetery and ultrasound measurements on YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ suggest that the pseudogap onset below a temperature T* coincides with a bona fide thermodynamic phase transition that breaks time-reversal, four-fold rotation and mirror symmetries respectively. However, the full point group above and below T* has not been resolved and the fate of this transition as T* approaches the superconducting critical temperature T$_c$ is poorly understood. Here we reveal the point group of YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ inside its pseudogap and neighboring regions using high sensitivity linear and second harmonic optical anisotropy measurements. We show that spatial inversion and two-fold rotational symmetries are broken below T* while mirror symmetries perpendicular to the Cu-O plane are absent at all temperatures. This transition occurs over a wide doping range and persists inside the superconducting dome, with no detectable coupling to either charge ordering or superconductivity. These results suggest that the pseudogap region coincides with an odd-parity order that does not arise from a competing Fermi surface instability and exhibits a quantum phase transition inside the superconducting dome.

"  We present a detailed structural investigation of the organic superconductor $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu[N(CN)$_2$]Br at temperatures $T$ from 9 to 300 K. Anomalies in the $T$ dependence of the lattice parameters are associated with a glass-like transition previously reported at $T_g$ = 77 K. From structure refinements at 9, 100 and 300 K, the orthorhombic crystalline symmetry, space group {\it Pnma}, is established at all temperatures. Further, we extract the $T$ dependence of the occupation factor of the eclipsed conformation of the terminal ethylene groups of the BEDT-TTF molecule. At 300 K, we find 67(2) %, with an increase to 97(3) % at 9 K. We conclude that the glass-like transition is not primarily caused by configurational freezing-out of the ethylene groups.

"  Motivated by some alternatives to the classical logical model of boolean algebra, this paper deals with algebraic structures which extend skew lattices by locally invertible elements. Following the meme of the Ehresmann-Schein-Nambooripad theorem, we consider a groupoid (small category of isomorphisms) in which the set of objects carries the structure of a skew lattice. The objects act on the morphisms by left and right restriction and extension mappings of the morphisms, imitating those of an inductive groupoid. Conditions are placed on the actions, from which pseudoproducts may be defined. This gives an algebra of signature (2,2,1), in which each binary operation has the structure of an orthodox semigroup. In the reverse direction, a groupoid of the kind described may be reconstructed from the algebra. ",Groupoids on a skew lattice of objects
"  We present deep 350- and 1200-micron imaging of the region around 4C41.17 -- one of the most distant (z = 3.792) and luminous known radio galaxies -- obtained with the Submillimeter High Angular Resolution Camera (SHARC-II) and the Max Planck Millimeter Bolometer Array (MAMBO). The radio galaxy is robustly detected at 350- and 1200-micron, as are two nearby 850-micron-selected galaxies; a third 850-micron source is detected at 350-micron and coincides with a ~ 2-sigma feature in the 1200-micron map. Further away from the radio galaxy an additional nine sources are detected at 1200-micron, bringing the total number of detected (sub)millimeter selected galaxies (SMGs) in this field to 14. Using radio images from the Very Large Array (VLA) and Spitzer mid-infrared (mid-IR) data, we find statistically robust radio and/or 24-micron counterparts to eight of the 14 SMGs in the field around 4C41.17. Follow-up spectroscopy with Keck/LRIS has yielded redshifts for three of the eight robustly identified SMGs, placing them in the redshift range 0.5 < z < 2.7, i.e. well below that of 4C41.17. We infer photometric redshifts for a further four sources using their 1.6-micron (rest-frame) stellar feature as probed by the IRAC bands; only one of them is likely to be at the same redshift as 4C41.17. Thus at least four, and as many as seven, of the SMGs within the 4C41.17 field are physically unrelated to the radio galaxy. With the redshift information at hand we are able to constrain the observed over-densities of SMGs within radial bins stretching to R=50 and 100"" (~ 0.4 and ~ 0.8Mpc at z ~ 3.8) from the radio galaxy to ~ 5x and ~ 2x that of the field, dropping off to the background value at R=150"".

"  The intellectual landscapes of the humanities are mostly uncharted territory. Little is known on the ways published research of humanist scholars defines areas of intellectual activity. An open question relates to the structural role of core literature: highly cited sources, naturally playing a disproportionate role in the definition of intellectual landscapes. We introduce four indicators in order to map the structural role played by core sources into connecting different areas of the intellectual landscape of citing publications (i.e. communities in the bibliographic coupling network). All indicators factor out the influence of degree distributions by internalizing a null configuration model. By considering several datasets focused on history, we show that two distinct structural actions are performed by the core literature: a global one, by connecting otherwise separated communities in the landscape, or a local one, by rising connectivity within communities. In our study, the global action is mainly performed by small sets of scholarly monographs, reference works and primary sources, while the rest of the core, and especially most journal articles, acts mostly locally.

"  Research conducted in the framework of the J-PET project aims to develop a cost-effective total-body positron emission tomography scanner. As a first step on the way to construct a full-scale J-PET tomograph from long strips of plastic scintillators, a 24-strip prototype was built and tested. The prototype consists of detection modules arranged axially forming a cylindrical diagnostic chamber with the inner diameter of 360 mm and the axial field-of-view of 300 mm. Promising perspectives for a low-cost construction of a total-body PET scanner are opened due to an axial arrangement of strips of plastic scintillators, wchich have a small light attenuation, superior timing properties, and the possibility of cost-effective increase of the axial field-of-view. The presented prototype comprises dedicated solely digital front-end electronic circuits and a triggerless data acquisition system which required development of new calibration methods including time, thresholds and gain synchronization. The system and elaborated calibration methods including first results of the 24-module J-PET prototype are presented and discussed. The achieved coincidence resolving time equals to CRT = 490 $\pm$ 9 ps. This value can be translated to the position reconstruction accuracy $\sigma(\Delta l) =$ 18 mm which is fairly position-independent.

"  Control of wire-borne underactuated brachiating robots requires a robust feedback control design that can deal with dynamic uncertainties, actuator constraints and unmeasurable states. In this paper, we develop a robust feedback control for brachiating on flexible cables, building on previous work on optimal trajectory generation and time-varying LQR controller design. We propose a novel simplified model for approximation of the flexible cable dynamics, which enables inclusion of parametric model uncertainties in the system. We then use semidefinite programming (SDP) and sum-of-squares (SOS) optimization to synthesize a time-varying feedback control with formal robustness guarantees to account for model uncertainties and unmeasurable states in the system. Through simulation, hardware experiments and comparison with a time-varying LQR controller, it is shown that the proposed robust controller results in relatively large robust backward reachable sets and is able to reliably track a pre-generated optimal trajectory and achieve the desired brachiating motion in the presence of parametric model uncertainties, actuator limits, and unobservable states.

"  We suggest that low-lying eigenvalues of realistic quantum many-body hamiltonians, given, as in the nuclear shell model, by large matrices, can be calculated, instead of the full diagonalization, by the diagonalization of small truncated matrices with the exponential extrapolation of the results. We show numerical data confirming this conjecture. We argue that the exponential convergence in an appropriate basis may be a generic feature of complicated (""chaotic"") systems where the wave functions are localized in this basis.

"  We theoretically investigate the incident-photon energy omega_i dependence of resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) tuned for the Cu L edge in cuprate superconductors by using the exact diagonalization technique for a single-band Hubbard model. Depending on the value of core-hole Coulomb interaction in the intermediate state, RIXS for non-spin-flip channel shows either a omega_i-dependent fluorescencelike or omega_i-independent Raman-like behavior for hole doping. An analysis of x-ray absorption suggests that the core-hole Coulomb interaction is larger than on-site Coulomb interaction in the Hubbard model, resulting in a fluorescencelike behavior in RIXS consistent with recent RIXS experiments. A shift on the high-energy side of the center of spectral distribution is also predicted for electron-doped systems though spectral weight is small. Main structures in spin-flip channel exhibit a Raman-like behavior as expected, accompanied with a fluorescencelike behavior with small intensity.

"  We consider the potential for the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) to detect transit timing variations (TTVs) during both its nominal and extended mission phases. Building on previous estimates of the overall yield of planetary systems from the TESS mission, we predict that during its nominal two-year mission, TESS will observe measurable TTVs in $\sim30$ systems, from which $\mathcal{O}(10)$ planet will get precise mass measurements from TTVs alone, $\sim 5$ planets will have significant constraints placed on their masses from TTVs, and over a dozen systems will be singly-transiting TTV systems. We consider a number of different extended mission scenarios, and predict that in a typical scenario, an extended mission will allow TESS to increase the number of systems with measurable TTVs to a total of $\sim90$, from which $\sim 15$ planets will have precise mass measurements, another $\sim 15$ will have significant constraints placed on their masses, and $\sim60$ will be singly-transiting TTV systems. We also describe how follow-up transit observations of multi-planet systems discovered by the TESS mission can be optimally planned to maximize TTV mass and eccentricity constraints.

"  If massive neutrinos possess magnetic moments, they can undergo spin flip in a magnetic field. The magnetic fields needed for a meaningful measurement of neutrino moments could be very high and may occur in astronomical objects such as some supernovae or active galactic nuclei: they are typically chaotic ones.

Both helicities occur with equal probability, independently of the initial distribution. Observational consequences are discussed. ",Behavior of Neutrinos in Stochastic Magnetic Fields

On the other hand, we also show any subset with super-linear horizontal growth will have a $0$ stationary harmonic measure at every point.

As an application we prove that any possible aggregation process with growth rates proportional to the stationary harmonic measure has non zero measure at all times.

"  The synthetic dimension, a research topic of both fundamental significance and practical applications, is attracting increasing attention in recent years. In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework to construct arbitrary synthetic dimensions, or N-boson synthetic lattices, using multiple bosons on one-dimensional lattices. We show that a one-dimensional lattice hosting N indistinguishable bosons can be mapped to a single boson on a N-dimensional lattice with high symmetry. Band structure analyses on this N-dimensional lattice can then be mathematically performed to predict the existence of exotic eigenstates and the motion of N-boson wavepackets. As illustrative examples, we demonstrate the edge states in two-boson Su-Schrieffer-Heeger synthetic lattices without interactions, interface states in two-boson Su-Schrieffer-Heeger synthetic lattices with interactions, and weakly-bound triplon states in three-boson tight-binding synthetic lattices with interactions. The interface states and weakly-bound triplon states have not been thoroughly understood in previous literatures. Our proposed theoretical framework hence provides a novel perspective to explore the multi-boson dynamics on lattices with boson-boson interactions, and opens up a future avenue in the fields of multi-boson manipulation in quantum engineering.

  We define an embedding of the space of complex momenta and masses in perturbation theory into a universal projective space. This embedding is natural in the sense of properties of the vector bundle defined by Feynman integrals on the complement to Landau varieties. We point out that there is a holonomic D-module associated with individual Feynman integrals. We quote explicit generators for this D-module on the fully deformed space of particle momenta. This basis is quadratic in the derivatives. We conclude that there is holonomic D-module on the physical space of momenta. ,Universal deformation of particle momenta space in perturbation theory
"  Communication is a cornerstone of social interactions, be it with human or artificial intelligence (AI). Yet it can be harmful, depending on the honesty of the exchanged information. To study this, an agent based sociological simulation framework is presented, the reputation game. This illustrates the impact of different communication strategies on the agents' reputation. The game focuses on the trustworthiness of the participating agents, their honesty as perceived by others. In the game, each agent exchanges statements with the others about their own and each other's honesty, which lets their judgments evolve. Various sender and receiver strategies are studied, like sycophant, egocentricity, pathological lying, and aggressiveness for senders as well as awareness and lack thereof for receivers. Minimalist malicious strategies are identified, like being manipulative, dominant, or destructive, which significantly increase reputation at others' costs. Phenomena such as echo chambers, self-deception, deception symbiosis, clique formation, freezing of group opinions emerge from the dynamics. This indicates that the reputation game can be studied for complex group phenomena, to test behavioral hypothesis, and to analyze AI influenced social media. With refined rules it may help to understand social interactions, and to safeguard the design of non-abusive AI systems. ",Theoretical Modeling of Communication Dynamics
"  We present an analytical model that enables throughput evaluation of Opportunistic Spectrum Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OS-OFDMA) networks. The core feature of the model, based on a discrete time Markov chain, is the consideration of different channel and subchannel allocation strategies under different Primary and Secondary user types, traffic and priority levels. The analytical model also assesses the impact of different spectrum sensing strategies on the throughput of OS-OFDMA network. The analysis applies to the IEEE 802.22 standard, to evaluate the impact of two-stage spectrum sensing strategy and varying temporal activity of wireless microphones on the IEEE 802.22 throughput. Our study suggests that OS-OFDMA with subchannel notching and channel bonding could provide almost ten times higher throughput compared with the design without those options, when the activity and density of wireless microphones is very high. Furthermore, we confirm that OS-OFDMA implementation without subchannel notching, used in the IEEE 802.22, is able to support real-time and non-real-time quality of service classes, provided that wireless microphones temporal activity is moderate (with approximately one wireless microphone per 3,000 inhabitants with light urban population density and short duty cycles). Finally, two-stage spectrum sensing option improves OS-OFDMA throughput, provided that the length of spectrum sensing at every stage is optimized using our model.

"  Inspired by real world examples, e.g. the Internet, researchers have introduced an abundance of strategic games to study natural phenomena in networks. Unfortunately, almost all of these games have the conceptual drawback of being computationally intractable, i.e. computing a best response strategy or checking if an equilibrium is reached is NP-hard. Thus, a main challenge in the field is to find tractable realistic network formation models.   We address this challenge by investigating a very recently introduced model by Goyal et al. [WINE'16] which focuses on robust networks in the presence of a strong adversary who attacks (and kills) nodes in the network and lets this attack spread virus-like to neighboring nodes and their neighbors. Our main result is to establish that this natural model is one of the few exceptions which are both realistic and computationally tractable. In particular, we answer an open question of Goyal et al. by providing an efficient algorithm for computing a best response strategy, which implies that deciding whether the game has reached a Nash equilibrium can be done efficiently as well. Our algorithm essentially solves the problem of computing a minimal connection to a network which maximizes the reachability while hedging against severe attacks on the network infrastructure and may thus be of independent interest.

"  Theoretical studies of the production of real thermal photons in relativistic heavy ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) are performed. The space-time evolution of the colliding system is modelled using MUSIC, a 3+1D relativistic hydrodynamic simulation, using both its ideal and viscous versions. The inclusive spectrum and its azimuthal angular anisotropy are studied separately, and the relative contributions of the different photon sources are highlighted. It is shown that the photon v2 coefficient is especially sensitive to the details of the microscopic dynamics like the equation of state, the ratio of shear viscosity over entropy density, eta/s, and to the morphology of the initial state.

"  We explore synergies between the space-based Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) and the ground-based Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). In particular, we consider a scenario where the currently envisioned survey strategy for WFIRST's High Latitude Survey (HLS), i.e., 2000 square degrees in four narrow photometric bands is altered in favor of a strategy that combines rapid coverage of the LSST area (to full LSST depth) in one band. We find that a 5-month WFIRST survey in the W-band can cover the full LSST survey area providing high-resolution imaging for >95% of the LSST Year 10 gold galaxy sample. We explore a second, more ambitious scenario where WFIRST spends 1.5 years covering the LSST area. For this second scenario we quantify the constraining power on dark energy equation of state parameters from a joint weak lensing and galaxy clustering analysis, and compare it to an LSST-only survey and to the Reference WFIRST HLS survey. Our survey simulations are based on the WFIRST exposure time calculator and redshift distributions from the CANDELS catalog. Our statistical uncertainties account for higher-order correlations of the density field, and we include a wide range of systematic effects, such as uncertainties in shape and redshift measurements, and modeling uncertainties of astrophysical systematics, such as galaxy bias, intrinsic galaxy alignment, and baryonic physics. Assuming the 5-month WFIRST wide scenario, we find a significant increase in constraining power for the joint LSST+WFIRST wide survey compared to LSST Y10 (FoM(Wwide)= 2.4 FoM(LSST)) and compared to LSST+WFIRST HLS (FoM(Wwide)= 5.5 FoM(HLS)).

"  We investigated the size distribution of high-inclination main-belt asteroids (MBAs) to explore asteroid collisional evolution under hypervelocity collisions of around 10 km/s. We performed a wide-field survey for high-inclination sub-km MBAs using the 8.2-m Subaru Telescope with the Subaru Prime Focus Camera (Suprime-Cam). Suprime-Cam archival data were also used. A total of 616 MBA candidates were detected in an area of 9.0 deg^2 with a limiting magnitude of 24.0 mag in the SDSS r filter. Most of candidate diameters were estimated to be smaller than 1 km. We found a scarcity of sub-km MBAs with high inclination. Cumulative size distributions (CSDs) were constructed using Subaru data and published asteroid catalogs. The power-law indexes of the CSDs were 2.17 +/- 0.02 for low-inclination (< 15 deg) MBAs and 2.02 +/- 0.03 for high-inclination (> 15 deg) MBAs in the 0.7-50 km diameter range. The high-inclination MBAs had a shallower CSD. We also found that the CSD of S-like MBAs had a small slope with high inclination, whereas the slope did not vary with inclination in the C-like group. The most probable cause of the shallow CSD of the high-inclination S-like MBAs is the large power-law index in the diameter-impact strength curve in hypervelocity collisions. The collisional evolution of MBAs may have advanced with oligopolistic survival during the dynamical excitation phase in the final stage of planet formation.

"  We study the macroscopic quantum self-trapping effect in a mixture of Bose-Einstein condensate and a large number of quantum degenerate fermions, trapped in a double-well potential with a variable separation between the wells. The large number of fermions localized in each well form quasi-static impurities that affect the dynamics of the bosonic cloud. Our semi-analytical analysis based on a mean-field model shows that main features of macroscopic quantum self trapping in a pure bosonic system are radically modified by the influence of fermions, with both the onset of self-trapping and properties of the self-trapped state depending on the fermion concentration as well as on the type of inter-species interaction. Remarkably, repulsive inter-species interaction leads to population inversion of the bosonic energy levels in the trapping potential and hence to the inversion of symmetry of the macroscopic wavefunction. Realistic physical estimates are given based on experimental parameters for a $^{40}$K-$^{87}$Rb system. ",Macroscopic quantum self-trapping in a Bose-Josephson junction with   fermions

We axiomatize the filtration and prove analog of several structural results about equivariant cohomology rings in this setting. We apply this abstract theory to study the $\mathbb{F}_p$ cohomology rings of classifying spaces of compact Lie groups, and show how to recover geometric results about the cohomology of $BG$ using equivariant cohomology. This includes some results about detection on subgroups and restrictions on associated primes that were previously only known for finite groups.   We are particularly interested in the local cohomology modules of equivariant cohomology rings, and we construct a tractable chain complex computing local cohomology. As an application, we study the local cohomology of the group cohomology of the p-Sylow subgroups of $S_{p^n}$ and give vanishing and nonvanishing results for these local cohomology modules that are sharper than those given by the current theory.

These knot complements can be constructed via long Dehn fillings on fully augmented links complements. We show that such knot complements have no hidden symmetries, which implies that there are at most two other knot complements in their respective commensurability classes. Under mild additional hypotheses, we show that these knots have at most four (orientation-preserving) symmetries and are the only knot complements in their respective commensurability classes. Finally, we provide an infinite family of explicit examples of $(\epsilon, d_L)$-twisted knot complements that are the unique knot complements in their respective commensurability classes obtained by filling a fully augmented link with four crossing circles.

"  The effects of galaxy selection on our ability to constrain the nature of weak Ly\alpha absorbers at low redshift are explored. Current observations indicate the existence of a population of gas-rich, low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies, and these galaxies may have large cross sections for Ly\alpha absorption. Absorption arising in LSB galaxies may be attributed to HSB galaxies at larger impact parameters from quasar lines of sight, so that the observed absorption cross sections of galaxies may seem unreasonably large. Thus it is not possible to rule out scenarios where LSB galaxies make substantial contributions to Ly\alpha absorption using direct observations. Less direct tests, where observational selection effects are taken into account using simulations, should make it possible to determine the nature of Ly\alpha absorbers by observing a sample of ~100 galaxies around quasar lines of sight with well-defined selection criteria. Such tests, which involve comparing simulated and observed plots of the unidentified absorber fractions and absorbing galaxy fractions versus impact parameter, can distinguish between scenarios where absorbers arise in particular galaxies and those where absorbers arise in gas tracing the large scale galaxy distribution. Care must be taken to minimize selection effects even when using these tests. Results from such tests are likely to depend upon the limiting neutral hydrogen column density. While not enough data are currently available to make a strong conclusion about the nature of moderately weak absorbers, evidence is seen that such absorbers arise in gas that is around or between galaxies that are often not detected in surveys.

"  We use the covariant spectator theory with an effective quark-antiquark interaction, containing Lorentz scalar, pseudoscalar, and vector contributions, to calculate the masses and vertex functions of, simultaneously, heavy and heavy-light mesons. We perform least-square fits of the model parameters, including the quark masses, to the meson spectrum and systematically study the sensitivity of the parameters with respect to different sets of fitted data. We investigate the influence of the vector confining interaction by using a continuous parameter controlling its weight. We find that vector contributions to the confining interaction between 0% and about 30% lead to essentially the same agreement with the data. Similarly, the light quark masses are not very tightly constrained. In all cases, the meson mass spectra calculated with our fitted models agree very well with the experimental data. We also calculate the mesons wave functions in a partial wave representation and show how they are related to the meson vertex functions in covariant form.

"  Close binary systems of compact stars, due to the emission of gravitational radiation, may evolve into a phase in which the less massive star transfers mass to its companion. We describe mass transfer by using the model of Roche lobe overflow, in which mass is transferred through the first, or innermost, Lagrange point. Under conditions in which gravity is strong, the shapes of the equipotential surfaces and the Roche lobes are modified compared to the Newtonian case. We present calculations of the Roche lobe utilizing the second order post-Newtonian (2PN) approximation in the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner gauge. Heretofore, calculations of the Roche lobe geometry beyond the Newtonian case have not been available. Beginning from the general N-body Lagrangian derived by Damour and Schaffer, we develop the Lagrangian for a test particle in the vicinity of two massive compact objects. As an exact result for the transverse-traceless part of the Lagrangian is not available, we devise an approximation that is valid for regions close to the less massive star. We calculate the Roche lobe volumes, and provide a simple fitting formula for the effective Roche lobe radius analogous to that for the Newtonian case furnished by Eggleton. In contrast to the Newtonian case, in which the effective Roche radius depends only upon the mass ratio $q=m_1/m_2$, in the 2PN case the effective Roche lobe radius also depends on the ratio $z=2 (m_1+m_2)/a$ of the total mass and the orbital separation.

  We extend the well-known and widely used Exponential Random Graph Model (ERGM) by including nodal random effects to compensate for heterogeneity in the nodes of a network. The Bayesian framework for ERGMs proposed by Caimo and Friel (2011) yields the basis of our modelling algorithm. A central question in network models is the question of model selection and following the Bayesian paradigm we focus on estimating Bayes factors. To do so we develop an approximate but feasible calculation of the Bayes factor which allows one to pursue model selection. Two data examples and a small simulation study illustrate our mixed model approach and the corresponding model selection. ,Bayesian Exponential Random Graph Models with Nodal Random Effects
"  Cholesky factorization provides photonic lattices that are the isospectral partners or the square root of other arrays of coupled waveguides. The procedure is similar to that used in supersymmetric quantum mechanics. However, Cholesky decomposition requires initial positive definite mode coupling matrices and the resulting supersymmetry is always broken. That is, the isospectral partner has the same range than the initial mode coupling matrix. It is possible to force a decomposition where the range of the partner is reduced but the characteristic supersymmetric intertwining is lost. As an example, we construct the Cholesky isospectral partner and the square root of a waveguide necklace with cyclic symmetry. We use experimental parameters from telecommunication C-band to construct a finite element model of these Cholesky photonics lattices to good agreement with our analytic prediction.

"  We have determined the superconducting and magnetic properties of a hydrothermally synthesized powder sample of tetragonal FeS using muon spin rotation ({\mu}SR). The superconducting properties are entirely consistent with those of a recently published study, showing fully gapped behavior and giving a penetration depth of {\lambda}_{ab} = 204(3) nm. However, our zero-field {\mu}SR data are rather different and indicate the presence of a small, non-superconducting magnetic phase within the sample. These results highlight that sample-to-sample variations in magnetism can arise in hydrothermally prepared phases, but interestingly the superconducting behavior is remarkably insensitive to these variations.

"  Baryon acoustic oscillations, measured through the patterned distribution of galaxies or other baryon tracing objects on very large (100 Mpc) scales, offer a possible geometric probe of cosmological distances. Pluses and minuses in this approach's leverage for understanding dark energy are discussed, as are systematic uncertainties requiring further investigation. Conclusions are that 1) BAO offer promise of a new avenue to distance measurements and further study is warranted, 2) the measurements will need to attain ~1% accuracy (requiring a 10000 square degree spectroscopic survey) for their dark energy leverage to match that from supernovae, but do give complementary information at 2% accuracy. Because of the ties to the matter dominated era, BAO is not a replacement probe of dark energy, but a valuable complement. ",The Ups and Downs of Baryon Oscillations

We prove that any $G$-irreducible, $G$-cohomologically rigid local system on $X$ with finite order abelianization and quasi-unipotent local monodromies is integral. This generalizes work of Esnault and Groechenig when $G= \mathrm{GL}_n$, and it answers positively a conjecture of Simpson for $G$-cohomologically rigid local systems. Along the way we show that the connected component of the Zariski-closure of the monodromy group of any such local system is semisimple. ",G-rigid local systems are integral
"  The evolution of correlations in the \emph{exactly} solvable Luttinger model (a model of interacting fermions in one dimension) after a sudden interaction switch-on is \emph{analytically} studied. When the model is defined on a finite-size ring, zero-temperature correlations are periodic in time. However, in the thermodynamic limit, the system relaxes algebraically towards a stationary state which is well described, at least for some simple correlation functions, by the generalized Gibbs ensemble recently introduced by Rigol \emph{et al.} [cond-mat/0604476]. The critical exponent that characterizes the decay of the one-particle correlation function is different from the known equilibrium exponents. Experiments for which these results can be relevant are also discussed. ",The Luttinger model following a sudden interaction switch-on
"  We present long-slit HST/STIS measurements of the ionized-gas kinematics in the nucleus of three disk galaxies, namely NGC 2179, NGC 4343, NGC 4435. The sample galaxies have been selected on the basis of their ground-based spectroscopy, for displaying a strong central velocity gradient for the ionized gas, which is consistent with the presence of a circum nuclear keplerian disk (CNKD, Bertola et al. 1998; Funes et al. 2002) rotating around a super massive black hole (SMBH). For each target galaxy we obtained the H_alpha and [NII] 6583 AA kinematics along the major axis and two 0""25 parallel offset positions. Out of three objects only NGC 4435 turned out to have a disk of ionized gas in regular motion and a regular dust-lane morphology. Preliminary modeling indicates a SMBH mass one order of magnitude lower than the one expected from the M-sigma relation for galaxies (Ferrarese & Merritt 2000; Gebhardt et al. 2000).

"  Migration and replication of virtual network functions (VNFs) are well-known mechanisms to face dynamic resource requests in Internet Service Provider (ISP) edge networks. They are not only used to reallocate resources in carrier networks, but in case of excessive traffic churns also to offloading VNFs to third party cloud providers. We propose to study how traffic forecasting can help to reduce the number of required migrations and replications when the traffic dynamically changes in the network. We analyze and compare three scenarios for the VNF migrations and replications based on: (i) the current observed traffic demands only, (ii) specific maximum traffic demand value observed in the past, or (iii) predictive traffic values. For the prediction of traffic demand values, we use an LSTM model which is proven to be one of the most accurate methods in time series forecasting problems. Based the traffic prediction model, we then use a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model as well as a greedy algorithm to solve this optimization problem that considers migrations and replications of VNFs. The results show that LSTM-based traffic prediction can reduce the number of migrations up to 45\% when there is enough available resources to allocate replicas, while less cloud-based offloading is required compared to overprovisioning.

"  We present recent {\it Chandra} X-ray observations of the RXJ0821.0+0752 galaxy cluster in addition to ALMA observations of the CO(1-0) and CO(3-2) line emission tracing the molecular gas in its central galaxy. All of the CO line emission, originating from a $10^{10}\,M_{\odot}$ molecular gas reservoir, is located several kpc away from the nucleus of the central galaxy. The cold gas is concentrated into two main clumps surrounded by a diffuse envelope. They form a wide filament coincident with a plume of bright X-ray emission emanating from the cluster core. This plume encompasses a putative X-ray cavity that is only large enough to have uplifted a few percent of the molecular gas. Unlike other brightest cluster galaxies, stimulated cooling, where X-ray cavities lift low entropy cluster gas until it becomes thermally unstable, cannot have produced the observed gas reservoir. Instead, the molecular gas has likely formed as a result of sloshing motions in the intracluster medium induced by a nearby galaxy. Sloshing can emulate uplift by dislodging gas from the galactic center. This gas has the shortest cooling time, so will condense if disrupted for long enough.

"  We construct multisphaleron solutions in the weak interactions. The multisphaleron solutions carry Chern-Simons charge $n/2$, where $n$ is an integer. The well-known sphaleron has $n=1$ and is spherically symmetric for vanishing mixing angle. In contrast the multisphalerons with $n>1$ are only axially symmetric, even for vanishing mixing angle. The greater $n$, the stronger the energy density deforms. While for small Higgs masses the energy of the multisphalerons is smaller than $n$ times the energy of the sphaleron, the energy of the multisphalerons is larger than $n$ times the energy of the sphaleron for large Higgs masses.

"  The spin of the massive black hole (BH) at the center of the Milky Way, SgrA$^*$, has been poorly constrained so far. We place an upper limit on the spin of SgrA$^*$ based on the spatial distribution of the S-stars, which are arranged in two almost edge-on disks that are located at a position angle approximately $\pm 45^\circ$ with respect to the Galactic plane, on a milliparsec scale around the Galactic Center. Requiring that the frame-dragging precession has not had enough time to make the S-star orbital angular momentum precess, the spin of the massive BH at the center of the Milky Way can be constrained to $\chi\lesssim 0.1$.

"  In this correspondence, we analyze the ergodic capacity of a large uplink multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) system over generalized-$K$ fading channels. In the considered scenario, multiple users transmit their information to a base station equipped with a very large number of antennas. Since the effect of fast fading asymptotically disappears in massive MIMO systems, large-scale fading becomes the most dominant factor for the ergodic capacity of massive MIMO systems. Regarding this fact, in our work we concentrate our attention on the effects of large-scale fading for massive MIMO systems. Specifically, some interesting and novel lower bounds of the ergodic capacity have been derived with both perfect channel state information (CSI) and imperfect CSI. Simulation results assess the accuracy of these analytical expressions. ",The Role of Large-Scale Fading in Uplink Massive MIMO Systems
"  In this paper, Nash equilibrium seeking among a network of players is considered. Different from many existing works on Nash equilibrium seeking in non-cooperative games, the players considered in this paper cannot directly observe the actions of the players who are not their neighbors. Instead, the players are supposed to be capable of communicating with each other via an undirected and connected communication graph. By a synthesis of a leader-following consensus protocol and the gradient play, a distributed Nash equilibrium seeking strategy is proposed for the non-cooperative games. Analytical analysis on the convergence of the players' actions to the Nash equilibrium is conducted via Lyapunov stability analysis. For games with non-quadratic payoffs, where multiple isolated Nash equilibria may coexist in the game, a local convergence result is derived under certain conditions. Then, a stronger condition is provided to derive a non-local convergence result for the non-quadratic games. For quadratic games, it is shown that the proposed seeking strategy enables the players' actions to converge to the Nash equilibrium globally under the given conditions. Numerical examples are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed seeking strategy. ",Distributed Nash Equilibrium Seeking by A Consensus Based Approach
"  The extension of quantum trajectory theory to incorporate realistic imperfections in the measurement of solid-state qubits is important for quantum computation, particularly for the purposes of state preparation and error-correction as well as for readout of computations. Previously this has been achieved for low-frequency (dc) weak measurements. In this paper we extend realistic quantum trajectory theory to include radio frequency (rf) weak measurements where a low-transparency quantum point contact (QPC), coupled to a charge qubit, is used to damp a classical oscillator circuit. The resulting realistic quantum trajectory equation must be solved numerically. We present an analytical result for the limit of large dissipation within the oscillator (relative to the QPC), where the oscillator slaves to the qubit. The rf+dc mode of operation is considered. Here the QPC is biased (dc) as well as subjected to a small-amplitude sinusoidal carrier signal (rf). The rf+dc QPC is shown to be a low-efficiency charge-qubit detector, that may nevertheless be higher than the dc-QPC (which is subject to 1/f noise).

"  The results of an optical and infrared investigation of a complete sub-sample of the Leiden-Berkeley Deep Survey (flux > 1 mJy at 1.4 GHz) are presented. Optical counterparts have been identified for 69 of the 73 sources in the two Hercules fields, and redshifts obtained for 49 of them. Photometric redshifts are computed from the g,r,i,K data for the remaining 21 sources. This complete sample is compared with the radio luminosity functions (RLFs) of Dunlop and Peacock (1990). The RLF models successfully trace the evolution of the radio sources with redshift, but there is some disagreement between the luminosity-dependence of the models and the data. The observed RLF for the lower luminosity population (log P < 26) shows evidence for a cut-off at lower redshifts (z=0.5-1.5) than for the more powerful objects.

"  Future Internet of Things (IoT) applications will require that billions of wireless devices transmit data to the cloud frequently. However, the wireless medium access is pointed as a problem for the next generations of wireless networks; hence, the number of data transmissions in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) can quickly become a bottleneck, disrupting the exponential growth in the number of interconnected devices, sensors, and amount of produced data. Therefore, keeping a low number of data transmissions is critical to incorporate new sensor nodes and measure a great variety of parameters in future generations of WSNs. Thanks to the high accuracy and low complexity of state-of-the-art forecasting algorithms, Dual Prediction Schemes (DPSs) are potential candidates to optimize the data transmissions in WSNs at the finest level because they facilitate for sensor nodes to avoid unnecessary transmissions without affecting the quality of their measurements. In this work, we present a sensor network model that uses statistical theorems to describe the expected impact of DPSs and data aggregation in WSNs. We aim to provide a foundation for future works by characterizing the theoretical gains of processing data in sensors and conditioning its transmission to the predictions' accuracy. Our simulation results show that the number of transmissions can be reduced by almost 98% in the sensor nodes with the highest workload. We also detail the impact of predicting and aggregating transmissions according to the parameters that can be observed in common scenarios, such as sensor nodes' transmission ranges, the correlation between measurements of different sensors, and the period between two consecutive measurements in a sensor.

"  Intrinsic electron- and hole-phonon interactions are investigated in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides MX$_2$ (M=Mo,W; X=S,Se) based on a density functional theory formalism. Due to their structural similarities, all four materials exhibit qualitatively comparable scattering characteristics with the acoustic phonons playing a dominant role near the conduction and valence band extrema at the K point. However, substantial differences are observed quantitatively leading to disparate results in the transport properties. Of the considered, WS$_2$ provides the best performance for both electrons and holes with high mobilities and saturation velocities in the full-band Monte Carlo analysis of the Boltzmann transport equation. It is also found that monolayer MX$_2$ crystals with an exception of MoSe$_2$ generally show hole mobilities comparable to or even larger than the value for bulk silicon at room temperature, suggesting a potential opportunity in p-type devices. The analysis is extended to estimate the effective deformation potential constants for a simplified treatment as well.

"  Executing scientific workflows with heterogeneous tasks on HPC platforms poses several challenges which will be further exacerbated by the upcoming exascale platforms. At that scale, bespoke solutions will not enable effective and efficient workflow executions. In preparation, we need to look at ways to manage engineering effort and capability duplication across software systems by integrating independently developed, production-grade software solutions. In this paper, we integrate RADICAL-Pilot (RP) and Parsl and develop an MPI executor to enable the execution of workflows with heterogeneous (non)MPI Python functions at scale. We characterize the strong and weak scaling of the integrated RP-Parsl system when executing two use cases from polar science, and of the function executor on both SDSC Comet and TACC Frontera. We gain engineering insight about how to analyze and integrate workflow and runtime systems, minimizing changes in their code bases and overall development effort. Our experiments show that the overheads of the integrated system are invariant of resource and workflow scale, and measure the impact of diverse MPI overheads. Together, those results define a blueprint towards an ecosystem populated by specialized, efficient, effective and independently-maintained software systems to face the upcoming scaling challenges.

"  We show that the fundamental objects of the $L_p$-Brunn-Minkowski theory, namely the $L_p$-affine surface areas for a convex body, are closely related to information theory: they are exponentials of R\'enyi divergences of the cone measures of a convex body and its polar.   We give geometric interpretations for all R\'enyi divergences $D_\alpha$, not just for the previously treated special case of relative entropy which is the case $\alpha =1$. Now, no symmetry assumptions are needed and, if at all, only very weak regularity assumptions are required.   Previously, the relative entropies appeared only after performing second order expansions of certain expressions. Now already first order expansions makes them appear. Thus, in the new approach we detect ""faster"" details about the boundary of a convex body. ",R\'enyi Divergence and $L_p$-affine surface area for convex bodies
"  We report the observation of a distinct correlation between the kinetic fragility index $m$ and the reduced Arrhenius crossover temperature $\theta_A = T_A/T_g$ in various glass-forming liquids, identifying three distinguishable groups. In particular, for 11 glass-forming metallic liquids, we universally observe a crossover in the mean diffusion coefficient from high-temperature Arrhenius to low-temperature super-Arrhenius behavior at approximately $\theta_A \approx 2$ which is in the stable liquid phases. In contrast, for fragile molecular liquids, this crossover occurs at much lower $\theta_A \approx 1.4$ and usually in their supercooled states. The $\theta_A$ values for strong network liquids spans a wide range higher than 2. Intriguingly, the high-temperature activation barrier $E_\infty$ is universally found to be $\sim 11\ k_B T_g$ and uncorrelated with the fragility or the reduced crossover temperature $\theta_A$ for metallic and molecular liquids. These observations provide a way to estimate the low-temperature glassy characteristics ($T_g$ and $m$) from the high-temperature liquid quantities ($E_\infty$ and $\theta_A$).

"  We present a high-angular-resolution molecular line and millimeter continuum study of the massive star formation site IRAS 05358+3543. The most remarkable feature is a highly collimated (collimation factor ~10) and massive (>10 M_sun) bipolar outflow of 1 pc length, which is part of a quadrupolar outflow system. The three observed molecular outflows forming the IRAS 05358+3543 outflow system resemble, in structure and collimation, those typical of low-mass star-forming regions. They might therefore, just like low-mass outflows, be explained by shock entrainment models of jets. We estimate a mass accretion rate of 10^{-4) M_sun/yr, sufficient to overcome the radiative pressure of the central object and to build up a massive star, lending further support to the hypothesis that massive star formation occurs similarly to low-mass star formation, only with higher accretion rates and energetics.

"  In spectral clustering, one defines a similarity matrix for a collection of data points, transforms the matrix to get the Laplacian matrix, finds the eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrix, and obtains a partition of the data using the leading eigenvectors. The last step is sometimes referred to as rounding, where one needs to decide how many leading eigenvectors to use, to determine the number of clusters, and to partition the data points. In this paper, we propose a novel method for rounding. The method differs from previous methods in three ways. First, we relax the assumption that the number of clusters equals the number of eigenvectors used. Second, when deciding the number of leading eigenvectors to use, we not only rely on information contained in the leading eigenvectors themselves, but also use subsequent eigenvectors. Third, our method is model-based and solves all the three subproblems of rounding using a class of graphical models called latent tree models. We evaluate our method on both synthetic and real-world data. The results show that our method works correctly in the ideal case where between-clusters similarity is 0, and degrades gracefully as one moves away from the ideal case.

"  Stars spend most of their lifetimes on the main sequence in the Hertzsprung--Russell diagram. The extended main-sequence turn-off regions -- containing stars leaving the main sequence after having spent all of the hydrogen in their cores -- found in massive (more than a few tens of thousands of solar masses), intermediate-age (about one to three billion years old) star clusters are usually interpreted as evidence of cluster-internal age spreads of more than 300 million years, although young clusters are thought to quickly lose any remaining star-forming fuel following a period of rapid gas expulsion on timescales of order $10^7$ years. Here we report that the stars beyond the main sequence in the two billion-year-old cluster NGC 1651, characterized by a mass of $\sim 1.7 \times 10^5$ solar masses, can be explained only by a single-age stellar population, even though the cluster has clearly extended main-sequence turn-off region. The most plausible explanation for the extended main-sequence turn-offs invokes the presence of a population of rapidly rotating stars, although the secondary effects of the prolonged stellar lifetimes associated with such a stellar-population mixture are as yet poorly understood. From preliminary analysis of previously obtained data, we find that similar morphologies are apparent in the Hertzsprung--Russell diagrams of at least five additional intermediate-age star clusters, suggesting that an extended main-sequence turn-off does not necessarily imply the presence of a significant cinternal age dispersion.

"  It was recently shown by Feldbrugge et al. that the no-boundary proposal, defined via a Lorentzian path integral and in minisuperspace, leads to unstable fluctuations, in disagreement with early universe observations. In these calculations many off-shell geometries summed over in the path integral in fact contain singularities, and the question arose whether the instability might ultimately be caused by these off-shell singularities. We address this question here by considering a sum over purely regular geometries, by extending a calculation pioneered by Halliwell and Louko. We confirm that the fluctuations are unstable, even in this restricted context which, arguably, is closer in spirit to the original proposal of Hartle and Hawking. Elucidating the reasons for the instability of the no-boundary proposal will hopefully show how to overcome these difficulties, or pave the way to new theories of initial conditions for the universe.

"  Detailed analyses of the temperature-dependent zero field ac susceptibility of prototypical phase-separated (La1-yPry)0.7Ca0.3Mn16/18O3, 0 < y < 1, reveal features consistent with the presence of a Griffiths phase (GP), viz., an inverse susceptibility characterized by power law with 0.05 < lamda < 0.33 as y decreases towards yc < 0.85. Beyond yc = 0.85, the GP is suppressed. These data, combined with previous neutron diffraction measurements, enable a phase diagram summarizing the evolution of the GP with composition to be constructed for this system; in particular, it shows that the disorder relevant for the establishment of such a phase is linked closely to the relative volume fractions of the phase separated antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic components, even when the recently estimated double exchange (DE) linked percolation threshold is exceeded. The influence of electron-phonon coupling can also be seen through oxygen isotope effects.

"  In the design of complex quantum systems like ion traps for quantum computing, it is usually desired to stabilize a particular system state or make the system state track a desired trajectory. Several control theoretical approaches based on feedback seem attractive to solve such problems. But the uncertain dynamics introduced by measurement on quantum systems makes the synthesis of feedback control laws very complicated. Although we have not explicitly modeled the change in system dynamics due to measurement (we have assumed weak measurements), this is a first step towards a more detailed analysis and closed-loop feedback design. Here, we present a Lyapunov-based control approach on the lines of that developed by Mirrahimi, Rouchon, Turnici (2005). The states are assumed to be obtained from weak measurements. The Lyapunov control technique has not been applied to realistic quantum systems so far. We have extended and applied the technique to two realistic physical systems - the quantum harmonic oscillator and the n-qubit system. We also propose to extend this concept to ion traps.

Analysis of the deep Spitzer MIPS 24 mu m imaging shows that there is also an excess of faint MIPS sources. All but two of the 11 HAEs are also found in the MIPS data. The inferred star-formation rate (SFR) of the HAEs based on the extinction-corrected Halpha luminosity (median SFR >~100 M_solar yr-1) is similar to those of HAEs in random fields at z~2. On the other hand, the MIPS-based SFR for the HAEs is on average 3.6 times larger, suggesting the existence of the star-formation significanly obscured by dust. The comparison of the Halpha-based star-formation activities of the HAEs in the 4C 23.56 field to those in another proto-cluster around PKS 1138-262 at z=2.16 reveals that the latter tend to have fainter Halpha emission despite similar K-band magnitudes. This suggests that star-formation may be suppressed in the PKS 1138-262 protocluster relative to the 4C 23.56 protocluster. This difference among the HAEs in the two proto-clusters at z > 2 may imply that some massive cluster galaxies are just forming at these epochs with some variation among clusters.

"  In the past two decades, the field of applied finance has tremendously benefited from graph theory. As a result, novel methods ranging from asset network estimation to hierarchical asset selection and portfolio allocation are now part of practitioners' toolboxes. In this paper, we investigate the fundamental problem of learning undirected graphical models under Laplacian structural constraints from the point of view of financial market times series data. In particular, we present natural justifications, supported by empirical evidence, for the usage of the Laplacian matrix as a model for the precision matrix of financial assets, while also establishing a direct link that reveals how Laplacian constraints are coupled to meaningful physical interpretations related to the market index factor and to conditional correlations between stocks. Those interpretations lead to a set of guidelines that practitioners should be aware of when estimating graphs in financial markets. In addition, we design numerical algorithms based on the alternating direction method of multipliers to learn undirected, weighted graphs that take into account stylized facts that are intrinsic to financial data such as heavy tails and modularity. We illustrate how to leverage the learned graphs into practical scenarios such as stock time series clustering and foreign exchange network estimation. The proposed graph learning algorithms outperform the state-of-the-art methods in an extensive set of practical experiments. Furthermore, we obtain theoretical and empirical convergence results for the proposed algorithms. Along with the developed methodologies for graph learning in financial markets, we release an R package, called fingraph, accommodating the code and data to obtain all the experimental results.

"  Vertex operator algebras are mathematically rigorous objects corresponding to chiral algebras in conformal field theory. Operads are mathematical devices to describe operations, that is, $n$-ary operations for all $n$ greater than or equal to $0$, not just binary products. In this paper, a reformulation of the notion of vertex operator algebra in terms of operads is presented. This reformulation shows that the rich geometric structure revealed in the study of conformal field theory and the rich algebraic structure of the theory of vertex operator algebras share a precise common foundation in basic operations associated with a certain kind of (two-dimensional) ``complex'' geometric object, in the sense in which classical algebraic structures (groups, algebras, Lie algebras and the like) are always implicitly based on (one-dimensional) ``real'' geometric objects. In effect, the standard analogy between point-particle theory and string theory is being shown to manifest itself at a more fundamental mathematical level. ",Vertex operator algebras and operads

"  Linear type systems need to keep track of how programs use their resources. The standard approach is to use context splits specifying how resources are (disjointly) split across subterms. In this approach, context splits redundantly echo information which is already present within subterms. An alternative approach is to use leftover typing, where in addition to the usual (input) usage context, typing judgments have also an output usage context: the leftovers. In this approach, the leftovers of one typing derivation are fed as input to the next, threading through linear resources while avoiding context splits. We use leftover typing to define a type system for a resource-aware {\pi}-calculus, a process algebra used to model concurrent systems. Our type system is parametrised over a set of usage algebras that are general enough to encompass shared types (free to reuse and discard), graded types (use exactly n number of times) and linear types (use exactly once). Linear types are important in the {\pi}-calculus: they ensure privacy and safety of communication and avoid race conditions, while graded and shared types allow for more flexible programming. We provide a framing theorem for our type system, generalise the weakening and strengthening theorems to include linear types, and prove subject reduction.

"  Neural bandits have enabled practitioners to operate efficiently on problems with non-linear reward functions. While in general contextual bandits commonly utilize Gaussian process (GP) predictive distributions for decision making, the most successful neural variants use only the last layer parameters in the derivation. Research on neural kernels (NK) has recently established a correspondence between deep networks and GPs that take into account all the parameters of a NN and can be trained more efficiently than most Bayesian NNs. We propose to directly apply NK-induced distributions to guide an upper confidence bound or Thompson sampling-based policy. We show that NK bandits achieve state-of-the-art performance on highly non-linear structured data. Furthermore, we analyze practical considerations such as training frequency and model partitioning. We believe our work will help better understand the impact of utilizing NKs in applied settings. ",An Empirical Study of Neural Kernel Bandits
"  Ductile fracture of metallic materials typically involves the elastoplastic deformation and associated damaging process. The nonlocal lattice particle method (LPM) can be extended to model this complex behavior. Recently, a distortional energy-based model is formulated into LPM to simulate J2 plasticity. However, this model is based on the incremental updating algorithm which needs very small loading steps to get reasonable results. This is time-consuming and unstable for large systems. Therefore, in this paper, a tensor-based return-mapping algorithm is proposed to deal with these deficiencies. The material deterioration process is modelled as a nonlocal damage evolution process. The particle-size/lattice dependency of macroscopic mechanical responses are handled properly by using the proposed model. Numerical examples of predicting the elastoplastic behavior of engineering structures with/without damage and fracture are also provided. A multi-threaded implementation of LPM using C is available on the website: https://github.com/ymlasu/LPM-C. ",A Nonlocal Damage-enhanced Lattice Particle Model for Ductile Fracture   Analysis
"  A scaling theory of long-wavelength electrostatic turbulence in a magnetised, weakly collisional plasma (e.g., ITG turbulence) is proposed, with account taken both of the nonlinear advection of the perturbed particle distribution by fluctuating ExB flows and of its phase mixing, which is caused by the streaming of the particles along the mean magnetic field and, in a linear problem, would lead to Landau damping. It is found that it is possible to construct a consistent theory in which very little free energy leaks into high velocity moments of the distribution function, rendering the turbulent cascade in the energetically relevant part of the wave-number space essentially fluid-like. The velocity-space spectra of free energy expressed in terms of Hermite-moment orders are steep power laws and so the free-energy content of the phase space does not diverge at infinitesimal collisionality (while it does for a linear problem); collisional heating due to long-wavelength perturbations vanishes in this limit (also in contrast with the linear problem, in which it occurs at the finite rate equal to the Landau-damping rate). The ability of the free energy to stay in the low velocity moments of the distribution function is facilitated by the ""anti-phase-mixing"" effect, whose presence in the nonlinear system is due to the stochastic version of the plasma echo (the advecting velocity couples the phase-mixing and anti-phase-mixing perturbations). The partitioning of the wave-number space between the (energetically dominant) region where this is the case and the region where linear phase mixing wins its competition with nonlinear advection is governed by the ""critical balance"" between linear and nonlinear timescales (which for high Hermite moments splits into two thresholds, one demarcating the wave-number region where phase mixing predominates, the other where plasma echo does).

"  IIn this article, we study the instanton equation on the cylinder over a closed manifold $X$ which admits non-zero smooth $3$-form $P$ and $4$-form $Q$. Our results are (1) if $X$ is a \textbf{good} manifold, i.e., $P,Q$ satisfying $d\ast_{X}P=d\ast_{X}Q=0$, then the instanton with integrable curvature decays exponentially at the ends, and, (2) if $X$ is a real Killing spinor manifold, i.e., $P,Q$ satisfying $dP=4Q$ and $d\ast_{X}Q=(n-3)\ast_{X}P$, we prove that the solution of instanton equation is trivial under some mild conditions.

"  Scheduled sampling is widely used to mitigate the exposure bias problem for neural machine translation. Its core motivation is to simulate the inference scene during training by replacing ground-truth tokens with predicted tokens, thus bridging the gap between training and inference. However, vanilla scheduled sampling is merely based on training steps and equally treats all decoding steps. Namely, it simulates an inference scene with uniform error rates, which disobeys the real inference scene, where larger decoding steps usually have higher error rates due to error accumulations. To alleviate the above discrepancy, we propose scheduled sampling methods based on decoding steps, increasing the selection chance of predicted tokens with the growth of decoding steps. Consequently, we can more realistically simulate the inference scene during training, thus better bridging the gap between training and inference. Moreover, we investigate scheduled sampling based on both training steps and decoding steps for further improvements. Experimentally, our approaches significantly outperform the Transformer baseline and vanilla scheduled sampling on three large-scale WMT tasks. Additionally, our approaches also generalize well to the text summarization task on two popular benchmarks. ",Scheduled Sampling Based on Decoding Steps for Neural Machine   Translation
"  In the context of load balancing, Lu et al. introduced the distributed Join-Idle-Queue algorithm, where a group of dispatchers distribute jobs to a cluster of parallel servers. Each dispatcher maintains a queue of idle servers; when a job arrives to a dispatcher, it sends it to a server on its queue, or to a random server if the queue is empty. In turn, when a server has no jobs, it requests to be placed on the idle queue of a randomly chosen dispatcher.   Although this algorithm was shown to be quite effective, the original asymptotic analysis makes simplifying assumptions that become increasingly inaccurate as the system load increases. Further, the analysis does not naturally generalize to interesting variations, such as having a server request to be placed on the idle queue of a dispatcher before it has completed all jobs, which can be beneficial under high loads.   We provide a new asymptotic analysis of Join-Idle-Queue systems based on mean field fluid limit methods, deriving families of differential equations that describe these systems. Our analysis avoids previous simplifying assumptions, is empirically more accurate, and generalizes naturally to the variation described above, as well as other simple variations. Our theoretical and empirical analyses shed further light on the performance of Join-Idle-Queue, including potential performance pitfalls under high load.

"  We propose a single-site mean-field description, an analogue of Weiss mean-field theory, suitable for narrow-band systems with correlation-induced hybridisation at finite temperatures. Presently this approach, based on the notion of a fluctuating on-site density matrix (OSDM), is developed for the case of extended Falicov-Kimball model (EFKM). In an EFKM, an excitonic insulator phase can be stabilised at zero temperature. With increasing temperature, the excitonic order parameter (interaction-induced hybridisation on-site, characterised by the absolute value and phase) eventually becomes disordered, which involves fluctuations of both its phase and (at higher T) its absolute value. In order to build an adequate finite-temperature description, it is important to clarify the nature of degrees of freedom associated with the phase and absolute value of the induced hybridisation, and correctly account for the corresponding phase-space volume. We show that the OSDM-based treatment of the local fluctuations indeed provides an intuitive and concise description (including the phase-space integration measure). This allows to describe both the lower-temperature regime where phase fluctuations destroy the long-range order, and the higher temperature crossover corresponding to a decrease of the absolute value of hybridisation. In spite of the rapid progress in the studies of excitonic insulators, a unified picture of this kind has not been available to date. We briefly discuss recent experiments on ${\rm Ta_2 Ni Se_5 }$ and also address the amplitude mode of collective excitations in relation to the measurements reported for 1T--${\rm TiSe_2}$. Both the overall scenario and the theoretical framework are also expected to be relevant in other contexts, including the Kondo lattice model.

"  This paper analyzes the equilibrium distribution of wealth in an economy where firms' productivities are subject to idiosyncratic shocks, returns on factors are determined in competitive markets, dynasties have linear consumption functions and government imposes taxes on capital and labour incomes and equally redistributes the collected resources to dynasties. The equilibrium distribution of wealth is explicitly calculated and its shape crucially depends on market incompleteness. In particular, a Paretian law in the top tail only arises if capital markets are incomplete. The Pareto exponent depends on the saving rate, on the net return on capital, on the growth rate of population and on portfolio diversification. On the contrary, the characteristics of the labour market mostly affects the bottom tail of the distribution of wealth. The analysis also suggests a positive relationship between growth and wealth inequality. ",Economic interactions and the distribution of wealth
  Here we demonstrate a novel smart magnetoplasmonic heterostructure for efficient control of light. It consists of gold nanoparticles embedded in a thin magnetic film covered with a gold layer pierces with periodic nanoslit array. Unique feature of the proposed structure is that it supports four different types of optical modes in the same frequency range including localized and propagating surface plasmons along with waveguide modes. A peculiar magneto-optical response appears at the frequencies of the mode hybridization. The most prominent result comes from hybridization of the localized and propagating plasmons leading to a significant increase of the magneto-optical intensity effect. ,Resonances of the magneto-optical intensity effect mediated by   interaction of different modes in a hybrid magnetoplasmonic heterostructure   with gold nanoparticles
"  Instance recognition is rapidly advanced along with the developments of various deep convolutional neural networks. Compared to the architectures of networks, the training process, which is also crucial to the success of detectors, has received relatively less attention. In this work, we carefully revisit the standard training practice of detectors, and find that the detection performance is often limited by the imbalance during the training process, which generally consists in three levels - sample level, feature level, and objective level. To mitigate the adverse effects caused thereby, we propose Libra R-CNN, a simple yet effective framework towards balanced learning for instance recognition. It integrates IoU-balanced sampling, balanced feature pyramid, and objective re-weighting, respectively for reducing the imbalance at sample, feature, and objective level. Extensive experiments conducted on MS COCO, LVIS and Pascal VOC datasets prove the effectiveness of the overall balanced design. ",Towards Balanced Learning for Instance Recognition
"  The functional diversity in factors identified in association with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) necessitates the utilization of holistic approaches to investigate the network properties of NAFLD pathogenesis. We describe the generation of the first mouse-specific multi-tissue metabolic model, the SteatoNet, to investigate NAFLD-related steatosis, by utilising an object-oriented modelling approach and incorporating numerous hepatic metabolic pathways, their interaction with peripheral tissues and hierarchical feedback regulation at the transcriptional and post-translational level. The unique validated model is based on steady-state analysis of ordinary differential equations that allows investigation of systemic behaviour in the absence of estimated kinetic parameters. Model analysis indicated the importance of the metabolic flux distribution parameter in controlling metabolite concentration and identified critical focal points in the network that may play a pivotal role in initiating NAFLD. Albeit requiring experimental validation, the candidate triggers identified by SteatoNet provide insight into the network properties of NAFLD and emphasize the promising scope and potential of SteatoNet as a primary investigative tool for hypotheses generation and exploring related metabolic diseases.

"  The finite-frequency dynamics of the $^4$He superfluid phase transition can be formulated in terms of the response of thermally excited vortex loops to an oscillating flow field. The key parameter is the Hausdorff fractal dimension $d_H$ of the loops, which affects the dynamics because the frictional force on a loop is proportional to the total perimeter $P$ of the loop, which varies as $P \sim a^{d_H}$ where $a$ is the loop diameter. Solving the 3D Fokker-Planck equation for the loop response at frequency $\omega $ yields a superfluid density which varies at $T_{\lambda}$ as $\omega^{1/(d_H -1)}$. This power-law variation with $\omega$ agrees with the scaling form found by Fisher, Fisher, and Huse, since the dynamic exponent $z$ is identified as $z = d_H-1$. Flory scaling for the self-avoiding loops gives a fractal dimension in terms of the space dimension $d$ as $d_H = (d+2)/2$, yielding $z = d/2 = 3/2$ for d = 3, in complete agreement with dynamic scaling.

"  Merging neutron star binaries are prime candidate sources for heavy r-process nucleosynthesis. The amount of heavy r-process material is consistent with the mass ejection and rates of mergers, and abundances of relic radioactive materials suggest that heavy r-process material is produced in rare events. Observations of possible macronovae provide further support for this model. Still, some concerns remain. One is the observation of heavy r-process elements in Ultra Faint Dwarf (UFD) galaxies. The escape velocities from UFDs are so small that the natal kicks, taking place at neutron stars birth, might eject such binaries from UFDs. Furthermore the old stellar populations of UFDs requires that r-process nucleosynthesis must have taken place very early on, while it may take several Gyr for compact binaries to merge. This last problem arises also within the Milky Way where heavy r-process materials has been observed in some low metallicity stars. We show here that since a significant fraction of neutron star binaries form with a very small proper motion those won't be ejected even from a UFD. Furthermore, a significant fraction of these binaries merge within a few hundred Myr and in some cases the merger time is even shorter than a hundred Myr. This population of ""rapid mergers"" explains the appearance of heavy r-process material in both UFDs and in the Milky Way.

"  Community detection is a fundamental problem in the analysis of complex networks. It is the analogue of clustering in network data mining. Within community detection methods, hierarchical algorithms are popular. However, their iterative nature and the need to recompute the structural properties used to split the network (i.e. edge betweenness in Girvan and Newman's algorithm), make them unsuitable for large network data sets. In this paper, we study how local structural network properties can be used as proxies to improve the efficiency of hierarchical community detection while, at the same time, achieving competitive results in terms of modularity. In particular, we study the potential use of the structural properties commonly used to perform local link prediction, a supervised learning problem where community structure is relevant, as nodes are prone to establish new links with other nodes within their communities. In addition, we check the performance impact of network pruning heuristics as an ancillary tactic to make hierarchical community detection more efficient ",On the use of local structural properties for improving the efficiency   of hierarchical community detection methods
"  We study clusters in Warm Dark Matter (WDM) models of a thermally produced dark matter particle $0.5$ keV in mass. We show that, despite clusters in WDM cosmologies having similar density profiles as their Cold Dark Matter (CDM) counterparts, the internal properties, such as the amount of substructure, shows marked differences. This result is surprising as clusters are at mass scales that are {\em a thousand times greater} than that at which structure formation is suppressed. WDM clusters gain significantly more mass via smooth accretion and contain fewer substructures than their CDM brethren. The higher smooth mass accretion results in subhaloes which are physically more extended and less dense. These fine-scale differences can be probed by strong gravitational lensing. We find, unexpectedly, that WDM clusters have {\em higher} lensing efficiencies than those in CDM cosmologies, contrary to the naive expectation that WDM clusters should be less efficient due to the fewer substructures they contain. Despite being less dense, the larger WDM subhaloes are more likely to have larger lensing cross-sections than CDM ones. Additionally, WDM subhaloes typically reside at larger distances, which radially stretches the critical lines associated with strong gravitational lensing, resulting in excess in the number of clusters with large radial cross-sections at the $\sim2\sigma$ level. Though lensing profile for an individual cluster vary significantly with the line-of-sight, the radial arc distribution based on a sample of $\gtrsim100$ clusters may prove to be the crucial test for the presence of WDM.

"  We have carried out VLA D-array observations of the C91alpha carbon recombination line as well as Effelsberg 100-m observations of the C65alpha line in a 5 arcmin square region centered between the Bar and the Trapezium stars in the Orion Nebula with spatial resolutions of 10 arcsec and 40 arcsec, respectively. The results show the ionized carbon in the PDR associated with the Orion Bar to be in a thin, clumpy layer sandwiched between the ionization front and the molecular gas. From the observed line widths we get an upper limit on the temperature in the C+ layer of 1500 K and from the line intensity a hydrogen density between 5 10^4 and 2.5 10^5 cm-3 for a homogeneous medium. The observed carbon level population is not consistent with predictions of hydrogenic recombination theory but could be explained by dielectronic recombination. The layer of ionized carbon seen in C91alpha is found to be essentially coincident with emission in the v=1-0 S(1) line of vibrationally excited molecular hydrogen. This is surprising in the light of current PDR models and some possible explanations of the discrepancy are discussed. ",Carbon recombination lines in the Orion Bar

"  We have developed an analytical method based on forward-modeling techniques to characterize the high-mass end of the red sequence (RS) galaxy population at redshift $z\sim0.55$, from the DR10 BOSS CMASS spectroscopic sample, which comprises $\sim600,000$ galaxies. The method, which follows an unbinned maximum likelihood approach, allows the deconvolution of the intrinsic CMASS colour-colour-magnitude distributions from photometric errors and selection effects. This procedure requires modeling the covariance matrix for the i-band magnitude, g-r colour and r-i colour using Stripe 82 multi-epoch data. Our results indicate that the error-deconvolved intrinsic RS distribution is consistent, within the photometric uncertainties, with a single point ($<0.05~{\rm{mag}}$) in the colour-colour plane at fixed magnitude, for a narrow redshift slice. We have computed the high-mass end ($^{0.55}M_i \lesssim -22$) of the $^{0.55}i$-band RS Luminosity Function (RS LF) in several redshift slices within the redshift range $0.52<z<0.63$. In this narrow redshift range, the evolution of the RS LF is consistent, within the uncertainties in the modeling, with a passively-evolving model with $\Phi_* = (7.248 \pm 0.204) \times10^{-4}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ mag$^{-1}$, fading at a rate of $1.5\pm0.4$ mag per unit redshift. We report RS completeness as a function of magnitude and redshift in the CMASS sample, which will facilitate a variety of galaxy-evolution and clustering studies using BOSS. Our forward-modeling method lays the foundations for future studies using other dark-energy surveys like eBOSS or DESI, which are affected by the same type of photometric blurring/selection effects.

"  Recent high-sensitivity observations carried out with ALMA have revealed the presence of complex organic molecules (COMs) such as methyl cyanide (CH$_{\rm 3}$CN) and methanol (CH$_{\rm 3}$OH) in relatively evolved protoplanetary discs.

We use this to investigate the evolution of formamide (NH$_{\rm 2}$CHO), a pre-biotic species, in both the disc and in the fragments that form within it. Our results show that formamide remains frozen onto grains in the majority of the disc where the temperatures are $<$100 K, with a predicted solid-phase abundance that matches those observed in comets. Formamide is present in the gas-phase in three fragments as a result of the high temperatures ($\geq$200\,K), but remains in the solid-phase in one colder ($\leq$150 K) fragment. The timescale over which this occurs is comparable to the dust sedimentation timescales, suggesting that any rocky core which is formed would inherit their formamide content directly from the protosolar nebula.

"  We consider ""virtual"" full-duplex relaying by means of half-duplex relays. In this configuration, each relay stage in a multi-hop relaying network is formed by at least two relays, used alternatively in transmit and receive modes, such that while one relay transmits its signal to the next stage, the other relay receives a signal from the previous stage. With such a pipelined scheme, the source is active and sends a new information message in each time slot. We consider the achievable rates for different coding schemes and compare them with a cut-set upper bound, which is tight in certain conditions. In particular, we show that both lattice-based Compute and Forward (CoF) and Quantize reMap and Forward (QMF) yield attractive performance and can be easily implemented. In particular, QMF in this context does not require ""long"" messages and joint (non-unique) decoding, if the quantization mean-square distortion at the relays is chosen appropriately. Also, in the multi-hop case the gap of QMF from the cut-set upper bound grows logarithmically with the number of stages, and not linearly as in the case of ""noise level"" quantization. Furthermore, we show that CoF is particularly attractive in the case of multi-hop relaying, when the channel gains have fluctuations not larger than 3dB, yielding a rate that does not depend on the number of relaying stages. In particular, we argue that such architecture may be useful for a wireless backhaul with line-of-sight propagation between the relays. ",Full-Duplex Relaying with Half-Duplex Relays

We then show how proximal gradient algorithms and semi-definite programming techniques can be employed to fit the model to thousands of variables. Through extensive simulations, we illustrate the conditions required for identifiability and show that there is a wide range of situations in which this model performs significantly better than its counterparts, for example, by accommodating more latent variables. Finally, the suggested method is applied to two datasets comprising individual level data on genetic variants and metabolites levels.

It is shown that for some typical laboratory and space plasmas, the Landau damping (and the nonlinear) effects are more pronounced than the finite Debye length (dispersive) effects for which the KdV soliton theory is not applicable to DAWs in dusty pair-ion plasmas. The properties of the linear phase velocity, solitary wave amplitudes (in presence and absence of the Landau damping) as well as the Landau damping rate are studied with the effects of the positive ion to dust density ratio $(\mu_{pd})$ as well as the ratios of positive to negative ion temperatures $(\sigma)$ and masses $(m)$.

"  We provide a systematic test of empirical theories of covalent bonding in solids using an exact procedure to invert ab initio cohesive energy curves. By considering multiple structures of the same material, it is possible for the first time to test competing angular functions, expose inconsistencies in the basic assumption of a cluster expansion, and extract general features of covalent bonding. We test our methods on silicon, and provide the direct evidence that the Tersoff-type bond order formalism correctly describes coordination dependence. For bond-bending forces, we obtain skewed angular functions that favor small angles, unlike existing models. As a proof-of-principle demonstration, we derive a Si interatomic potential which exhibits comparable accuracy to existing models.

"  In this paper we present a new search technique for electroweakinos, the superpartners of electroweak gauge and Higgs bosons, based on final states with missing transverse energy, a photon, and a dilepton pair, $\ell^+\,\ell^- + \gamma + \displaystyle{\not} E_T$. Unlike traditional electroweakino searches, which perform best when $m_{\widetilde{\chi}^0_{2,3}} - m_{\widetilde{\chi}^0_1}, m_{\widetilde{\chi}^{\pm}} - m_{\widetilde{\chi}^0_1} > m_Z$, our search favors nearly degenerate spectra; degenerate electroweakinos typically have a larger branching ratio to photons, and the cut $m_{\ell\ell} \ll m_Z$ effectively removes on-shell Z boson backgrounds while retaining the signal. This feature makes our technique optimal for `well-tempered' scenarios, where the dark matter relic abundance is achieved with inter-electroweakino splittings of $\sim 20 - 70\,\text{GeV}$. Additionally, our strategy applies to a wider range of scenarios where the lightest neutralinos are almost degenerate, but only make up a subdominant component of the dark matter -- a spectrum we dub `well-forged'. Focusing on bino-Higgsino admixtures, we present optimal cuts and expected efficiencies for several benchmark scenarios. We find bino-Higgsino mixtures with $m_{\widetilde{\chi}^0_{2,3}} \lesssim 190\,\text{GeV}$ and $m_{\widetilde{\chi}^0_{2,3}} - m_{\widetilde{\chi}^0_1} \cong 30\,\text{GeV}$ can be uncovered after roughly $600\,\text{fb}^{-1}$ of luminosity at the 14 TeV LHC. Scenarios with lighter states require less data for discovery, while scenarios with heavier states or larger mass splittings are harder to discriminate from the background and require more data. Unlike many searches for supersymmetry, electroweakino searches are one area where the high luminosity of the next LHC run, rather than the increased energy, is crucial for discovery.

"  Scaling properties of time series are usually studied in terms of the scaling laws of empirical moments, which are the time average estimates of moments of the dynamic variable. Nonlinearities in the scaling function of empirical moments are generally regarded as a sign of multifractality in the data. We show that, except for the Brownian motion, this method fails to disclose the correct monofractal nature of self-similar L\'evy processes. We prove that for this class of processes it produces apparent multifractality characterised by a piecewise-linear scaling function with two different regimes, which match at the stability index of the considered process. This result is motivated by previous numerical evidence. It is obtained by introducing an appropriate stochastic normalisation which is able to cure empirical moments, without hiding their dependence on time, when moments they aim at estimating do not exist. ",Apparent multifractality of self-similar L\'evy processes
"  We show that the low-density strongly interacting electron liquid, interacting via the long-range Coulomb interaction, could develop a dispersion instability at a critical density associated with the approximate flattening of the quasiparticle energy dispersion. At the critical density the quasiparticle effective mass diverges at the Fermi surface, but the signature of this Fermi surface instability manifests itself away from the Fermi momentum at higher densities. For densities below the critical density the system is unstable since the quasiparticle velocity becomes negative. We show that one physical mechanism underlying the dispersion instability is the emission of soft plasmons by the quasiparticles. The dispersion instability occurs both in two and three dimensional electron liquids. We discuss the implications of the dispersion instability for experiments at low electron densities.

"  We investigate the polarons formed by immersing a spinor impurity in a ferromagnetic state of $F=1$ spinor Bose-Einstein condensate. The ground state energies and effective masses of the polarons are calculated in both weak-coupling regime and strong-coupling regime. In the weakly interacting regime the second order perturbation theory is performed. In the strong coupling regime we use a simple variational treatment. The analytical approximations to the energy and effective mass of the polarons are constructed. Especially, a transition from the mobile state to the self-trapping state of the polaron in the strong coupling regime is discussed. We also estimate the signatures of polaron effects in spinor BEC for the future experiments. ",Polarons in a ferromagnetic spinor Bose-Einstein condensates
"  Numerous online stock image libraries offer high quality yet copyright free images for use in marketing campaigns. To assist advertisers in navigating such third party libraries, we study the problem of automatically fetching relevant ad images given the ad text (via a short textual query for images). Motivated by our observations in logged data on ad image search queries (given ad text), we formulate a keyword extraction problem, where a keyword extracted from the ad text (or its augmented version) serves as the ad image query. In this context, we propose VisualTextRank: an unsupervised method to (i) augment input ad text using semantically similar ads, and (ii) extract the image query from the augmented ad text. VisualTextRank builds on prior work on graph based context extraction (biased TextRank in particular) by leveraging both the text and image of similar ads for better keyword extraction, and using advertiser category specific biasing with sentence-BERT embeddings. Using data collected from the Verizon Media Native (Yahoo Gemini) ad platform's stock image search feature for onboarding advertisers, we demonstrate the superiority of VisualTextRank compared to competitive keyword extraction baselines (including an $11\%$ accuracy lift over biased TextRank). For the case when the stock image library is restricted to English queries, we show the effectiveness of VisualTextRank on multilingual ads (translated to English) while leveraging semantically similar English ads. Online tests with a simplified version of VisualTextRank led to a 28.7% increase in the usage of stock image search, and a 41.6% increase in the advertiser onboarding rate in the Verizon Media Native ad platform.

"  A large body of compelling evidence has been accumulated demonstrating that embodiment - the agent's physical setup, including its shape, materials, sensors and actuators - is constitutive for any form of cognition and as a consequence, models of cognition need to be embodied. In contrast to methods from empirical sciences to study cognition, robots can be freely manipulated and virtually all key variables of their embodiment and control programs can be systematically varied. As such, they provide an extremely powerful tool of investigation. We present a robotic bottom-up or developmental approach, focusing on three stages: (a) low-level behaviors like walking and reflexes, (b) learning regularities in sensorimotor spaces, and (c) human-like cognition. We also show that robotic based research is not only a productive path to deepening our understanding of cognition, but that robots can strongly benefit from human-like cognition in order to become more autonomous, robust, resilient, and safe.

"  Alcoholism is one of the most common diseases in the world. This type of substance abuse leads to mental and physical dependence on ethanol-containing drinks. Alcoholism is accompanied by progressive degradation of the personality and damage to the internal organs. Today still not exists a quick diagnosis method to detect this disease. This article presents the method for the quick and anonymous alcoholism diagnosis by neural networks. For this method, don't need any private information about the subject. For the implementation, we considered various algorithms of machine learning and deep neural networks. In detail analyzed the correlation of the signals from electrodes by neural networks. The wavelet transforms and the fast Fourier transform was considered. The manuscript demonstrates that the deep neural network which operates only with a dataset of EEG correlation signals can anonymously classify the alcoholic and control groups with high accuracy. On the one hand, this method will allow subjects to be tested for alcoholism without any personal data, which will not cause inconvenience or shame in the subject, and on the other hand, the subject will not be able to deceive specialists who diagnose the subject for the presence of the disease.

"  The present study further strenghtens the use of the Keedwell CIPQ against attack on a system. This is done as follows. The holomorphic structure of AIPQs(AIPLs) and CIPQs(CIPLs) are investigated. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the holomorph of a quasigroup(loop) to be an AIPQ(AIPL) or CIPQ(CIPL) are established. It is shown that if the holomorph of a quasigroup(loop) is a AIPQ(AIPL) or CIPQ(CIPL), then the holomorph is isomorphic to the quasigroup(loop). Hence, the holomorph of a quasigroup(loop) is an AIPQ(AIPL) or CIPQ(CIPL) if and only if its automorphism group is trivial and the quasigroup(loop) is a AIPQ(AIPL) or CIPQ(CIPL). Furthermore, it is discovered that if the holomorph of a quasigroup(loop) is a CIPQ(CIPL), then the quasigroup(loop) is a flexible unipotent CIPQ(flexible CIPL of exponent 2). By constructing two isotopic quasigroups(loops) $U$ and $V$ such that their automorphism groups are not trivial, it is shown that $U$ is a AIPQ or CIPQ(AIPL or CIPL) if and only if $V$ is a AIPQ or CIPQ(AIPL or CIPL). Explanations and procedures are given on how these CIPQs can be used to double encrypt information. ",A Double Cryptography Using The Keedwell Cross Inverse Quasigroup
"  Appearance of cosmic strings in the early Universe is a common manifestation of new physics typically linked to some high energy scale. In this paper, we discuss a different situation, where a model underlying cosmic string formation is approximately scale free. String tension is naturally related to the square of the temperature of the hot primordial plasma in such a setting, and hence decreases with (cosmic) time. With gravitational backreaction neglected, the dynamics of these melting strings in an expanding Universe is equivalent to the dynamics of constant tension strings in a Minkowski spacetime. We provide an estimate for the emission of gravitational waves from string loops. Contrary to the standard case, the resulting spectrum is markedly non-flat and has a characteristic falloff at frequencies below the peak one. The peak frequency is defined by the underlying model and lies in the range accessible by the future detectors for very weak couplings involved. ",Gravitational waves from melting cosmic strings
"  We investigate the optimal tradeoff between information gained about an unknown coherent state and the state disturbance caused by the measurement process. We propose several optical schemes that can enable this task, and we implement one of them, a scheme which relies on only linear optics and homodyne detection. Experimentally we reach near optimal performance, limited only by detection inefficiencies. In addition we show that such a scheme can be used to enhance the transmission fidelity of a class of noisy channels.

"  Using equations of motion accurate to the third post-Newtonian (3PN) order (O(v/c)^6 beyond Newtonian gravity), we derive expressions for the total energy E and angular momentum J of the orbits of compact binary systems (black holes or neutron stars) for arbitrary orbital eccentricity. We also incorporate finite-size contributions such as spin-orbit and spin-spin coupling, and rotational and tidal distortions, calculated to the lowest order of approximation, but we exclude the effects of gravitational radiation damping. We describe how these formulae may be used as an accurate diagnostic of the physical content of quasi-equilibrium configurations of compact binary systems of black holes and neutron stars generated using numerical relativity. As an example, we show that quasi-equilibrium configurations of corotating neutron stars recently reported by Miller et al. can be fit by our diagnostic to better than one per cent with a circular orbit and with physically reasonable tidal coefficients.

"  The source G2 has already completed its pericentre passage around Sgr A*, the super-massive black hole in the centre of our Galaxy. Although it has been monitored for 15 years, its astrophysical nature and origin still remain unknown. In this work, we aim to test the hypothesis of G2 being the result of a stellar wind collision. To do so, we study the motion and final fate of gas clumps formed as a result of collisions of stellar winds in massive binaries. Our approach is based on a test-particle model in order to describe the trajectories of such clumps. The model takes into account the gravitational field of Sgr A*, the interaction of the clumps with the interstellar medium as well as their finite lifetimes. Our analysis allows us to reject the hypothesis based on four arguments: i) if G2 has followed a purely Keplerian orbit since its formation, it cannot have been produced in any of the known massive binaries since their motions are not consistent; ii) in general, gas clumps are evaporated through thermal conduction on very short timescale (< 100yr) before getting close enough to Sgr A*; iii) IRS 16SW, the best candidate for the origin of G2, cannot generate clumps as massive as G2; and iv) clumps ejected from IRS 16SW describe trajectories significantly different to the observed motion of G2.

  Neural networks allow us to model complex relationships between variables. We show how to efficiently find extrema of a trained neural network in regression problems. Finding the extremizing input of an approximated model is formulated as the training of an additional neural network with a loss function that minimizes when the extremizing input is achieved. We further show how to incorporate additional constraints on the input vector such as limiting the extrapolation of the extremizing input vector from the original training data set. An instructional example of this approach using TensorFlow is included. ,Extremal learning: extremizing the output of a neural network in   regression problems

"  Missing data is an inevitable and ubiquitous problem for traffic data collection in intelligent transportation systems. Despite extensive research regarding traffic data imputation, there still exist two limitations to be addressed: first, existing approaches fail to capture the complex spatiotemporal dependencies in traffic data, especially the dynamic spatial dependencies evolving with time; second, prior studies mainly focus on randomly missing patterns while other more complex missing scenarios are less discussed. To fill these research gaps, we propose a novel deep learning framework called Dynamic Spatiotemporal Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (DSTGCN) to impute missing traffic data. The model combines the recurrent architecture with graph-based convolutions to model the spatiotemporal dependencies. Moreover, we introduce a graph structure estimation technique to model the dynamic spatial dependencies from real-time traffic information and road network structure. Extensive experiments based on two public traffic speed datasets are conducted to compare our proposed model with state-of-the-art deep learning approaches in four types of missing patterns. The results show that our proposed model outperforms existing deep learning models in all kinds of missing scenarios and the graph structure estimation technique contributes to the model performance. We further compare our proposed model with a tensor factorization model and find distinct behaviors across different model families under different training schemes and data availability.

"  WiMAX (acronym for Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) is a family of technical standards based on IEEE 802.16 standard that defines the high speed connection through radio waves unlike DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) or other wired technology. It can provide coverage to remote rural areas of several kilometers in radius, it's an adequate response to some rural or inaccessible areas. WiMAX can provide point-to-point (P2P) and point-to-multipoint (PMP) modes. In parallel, it was observed that, unlike the traditional assessment methods for quality, nowadays, current research focuses on the user perceived quality, the existing scheduling approaches take into account the quality of service (QoS) and many technical parameters, but does not take into account the quality of experience (QoE). In this paper, we present a scheduling algorithm to provide QoE in WiMAX network under Manhattan Mobility. A new approach is proposed, particularly for the Best Effort (BE) service class WiMAX, in this approach, if a packet loss occurs on a link connection, the system then reduces the transmission rate of this connection to obtain its minimum allowable transmission rate.

Using the expansion of the Hodge star of $\phi$ we work out the full curvature of this metric and relate it to the Yukawa coupling. ",Local geometry of the G2 moduli space
"  We analyse the stellar populations of 75 red-sequence dwarf galaxies in the Coma cluster, based on high signal-to-noise spectroscopy from the 6.5m MMT. The sample covers a luminosity range 3-4 magnitudes below M*, in the cluster core and in a field centred 1 deg to the south-west. We find a strong dependence of the absorption line strengths with location in the cluster. Galaxies further from the cluster centre have stronger Balmer lines than inner-field galaxies of the same luminosity. The magnesium lines are weaker at large radius, while the iron lines are not correlated with radius. Converting the line strengths into estimates of stellar age, metallicity and abundance ratios, we find the gradients are driven by variations in age (>6 sigma significance) and in the iron abundance Fe/H (~2.7 sigma significance). The light element (Mg, C, N, Ca) abundances are almost independent of radius. At radius of 0.4-1.3 degree (~0.3-1.0x the virial radius), dwarf galaxies have ages ~3.8 Gyr on average, compared to ~6 Gyr near the cluster centre. The outer dwarfs are also ~50% more iron-enriched, at given luminosity. Our results confirm earlier indications that the ages of red-sequence galaxies depend on location within clusters, and in Coma in particular. The exceptionally strong trends found here suggest that dwarf galaxies are especially susceptible to environmental ""quenching"", and/or that the south-west part of Coma is a particularly clear example of recent quenching in an infalling subcluster.

"  In this work, we show the first worst-case to average-case reduction for the classical $k$-SUM problem. A $k$-SUM instance is a collection of $m$ integers, and the goal of the $k$-SUM problem is to find a subset of $k$ elements that sums to $0$. In the average-case version, the $m$ elements are chosen uniformly at random from some interval $[-u,u]$.   We consider the total setting where $m$ is sufficiently large (with respect to $u$ and $k$), so that we are guaranteed (with high probability) that solutions must exist. Much of the appeal of $k$-SUM, in particular connections to problems in computational geometry, extends to the total setting.   The best known algorithm in the average-case total setting is due to Wagner (following the approach of Blum-Kalai-Wasserman), and achieves a run-time of $u^{O(1/\log k)}$. This beats the known (conditional) lower bounds for worst-case $k$-SUM, raising the natural question of whether it can be improved even further. However, in this work, we show a matching average-case lower-bound, by showing a reduction from worst-case lattice problems, thus introducing a new family of techniques into the field of fine-grained complexity. In particular, we show that any algorithm solving average-case $k$-SUM on $m$ elements in time $u^{o(1/\log k)}$ will give a super-polynomial improvement in the complexity of algorithms for lattice problems.

"  We reconcile a long-standing controversy regarding the transition temperature of the Bose-Einstein condensation in a dilute interacting Bose gas, by showing that there is a crossover between ideal gas and interacting gas. The former corresponds to a Knudsen (or collisionless) regime, in which the mean-free-path is much larger than the system dimension, while the latter corresponds to the opposite hydrodynamic regime. The deviation of the transition temperature from that of the non-interacting gas is proportional to the square root of a in the Knudsen regime, and to a in the hydrodynamic regime, where a is the scattering length. This crossover may be observable in a Bose gas trapped in a potential or on an optical lattice. ",Bose-Einstein condensation of a Knudsen gas

"  The internal composition of neutron stars is currently largely unknown. Due to the possibility of phase transitions in quantum chromodynamics, stars could be hybrid and have quark cores. We investigate some imprints of elastic quark phases (only when perturbed) on the dynamical stability of hybrid stars. We show that they increase the dynamical stability window of hybrid stars in the sense that the onset of instabilities happen at larger central densities than the ones for maximum masses. In particular, when the shear modulus of a crystalline quark phase is taken at face value, the relative radius differences between elastic and perfect-fluid hybrid stars with null radial frequencies (onset of instability) would be up to $1-2\%$. Roughly, this would imply a maximum relative radius dispersion (on top of the perfect-fluid predictions) of $2-4\%$ for stars in a given mass range exclusively due to the elasticity of the quark phase. In the more agnostic approach where the estimates for the quark shear modulus only suggest its possible order of magnitude (due to the many approximations taken in its calculation), the relative radius dispersion uniquely due to a quark phase elasticity might be as large as $5-10\%$. Finally, we discuss possible implications of the above dispersion of radii for the constraint of the elasticity of a quark phase with electromagnetic missions such as NICER, eXTP and ATHENA.

"  The $^{17}$O(p,$\alpha$)$^{14}$N reaction plays a key role in various astrophysical scenarios, from asymptotic giant branch stars to classical novae. It affects the synthesis of rare isotopes such as $^{17}$O and $^{18}$F, which can provide constraints on astrophysical models. A new direct determination of the $E_{\rm R}~=~64.5$~keV resonance strength performed at the Laboratory for Underground Nuclear Astrophysics accelerator has led to the most accurate value to date, $\omega\gamma = 10.0 \pm 1.4_{\rm stat} \pm 0.7_{\rm syst}$~neV, thanks to a significant background reduction underground and generally improved experimental conditions. The (bare) proton partial width of the corresponding state at $E_{\rm x} = 5672$~keV in $^{18}$F is $\Gamma_{\rm p} = 35 \pm 5_{\rm stat} \pm 3_{\rm syst}$~neV. This width is about a factor of 2 higher than previously estimated thus leading to a factor of 2 increase in the $^{17}$O(p,$\alpha$)$^{14}$N reaction rate at astrophysical temperatures relevant to shell hydrogen-burning in red giant and asymptotic giant branch stars. The new rate implies lower $^{17}$O/$^{16}$O ratios, with important implications on the interpretation of astrophysical observables from these stars.

"  Entanglement depth characterizes the minimal number of particles in a system that are mutually entangled. For symmetric states, we show that there is a dichotomy for entanglement depth: an $N$-particle symmetric state is either fully separable, or fully entangled---the entanglement depth is either $1$ or $N$. This property is even stable under non-symmetric noise. We propose an experimentally accessible method to detect entanglement depth in atomic ensembles based on a bound on the particle number population of Dicke states, and demonstrate that the entanglement depth of some Dicke states, for example the twin Fock state, is very stable even under a large arbitrary noise. Our observation can be applied to atomic Bose-Einstein condensates to infer that these systems can be highly entangled with the entanglement depth that is of the order of the system size (i.e. several thousands of atoms).

"  We investigate the rest-frame UV morphologies of a large sample of Lyman-a emitters (LAEs) from z~2 to z~6, selected in a uniform way with 16 different narrow- and medium-bands over the full COSMOS field. We use 3045 LAEs with HST coverage in a stacking analysis and find that they have M_UV~-20, below M*_UV at these redshifts. We also focus our analysis on a subsample of 780 individual galaxies with i_AB<25 for which GALFIT converges for 429 of them. The individual median size (re~1 kpc), ellipticities (slightly elongated with (b/a)~0.45), S\'ersic index (disk-like with n<2) and light concentration (comparable to that of disk or irregular galaxies, with C~2.7) of LAEs show mild evolution from z~2 to z~6. LAEs with the highest rest-frame equivalent widths (EW) are the smallest/most compact (re~0.8 kpc, compared to re~1.5 kpc for the lower EW LAEs). When stacking our samples in bins of fixed Lya luminosity and Lya EW we find evidence for redshift evolution in n and C, but not in galaxy sizes. The evolution seems to be stronger for LAEs with 25<EW<100 {\AA}. When compared to other SFGs, LAEs are found to be smaller at all redshifts. The difference between the two populations changes with redshift, from a factor of ~1 at z>5 to SFGs being a factor of ~2-4 larger than LAEs for z<2. This means that at the highest redshifts, where typical sizes approach those of LAEs, the fraction of galaxies showing Lya in emission (and with a high Lya escape fraction) should be much higher, consistent with observations.

"  Motivation   Protein fold recognition is an important problem in structural bioinformatics. Almost all traditional fold recognition methods use sequence (homology) comparison to indirectly predict the fold of a tar get protein based on the fold of a template protein with known structure, which cannot explain the relationship between sequence and fold. Only a few methods had been developed to classify protein sequences into a small number of folds due to methodological limitations, which are not generally useful in practice.   Results   We develop a deep 1D-convolution neural network (DeepSF) to directly classify any protein se quence into one of 1195 known folds, which is useful for both fold recognition and the study of se quence-structure relationship. Different from traditional sequence alignment (comparison) based methods, our method automatically extracts fold-related features from a protein sequence of any length and map it to the fold space. We train and test our method on the datasets curated from SCOP1.75, yielding a classification accuracy of 80.4%. On the independent testing dataset curated from SCOP2.06, the classification accuracy is 77.0%. We compare our method with a top profile profile alignment method - HHSearch on hard template-based and template-free modeling targets of CASP9-12 in terms of fold recognition accuracy. The accuracy of our method is 14.5%-29.1% higher than HHSearch on template-free modeling targets and 4.5%-16.7% higher on hard template-based modeling targets for top 1, 5, and 10 predicted folds. The hidden features extracted from sequence by our method is robust against sequence mutation, insertion, deletion and truncation, and can be used for other protein pattern recognition problems such as protein clustering, comparison and ranking.

"  For temporal magnitudes describing, in details, processes of particles scattering for a long time at each necessity case a particular, ad hoc reception were used. However the desirability of general approach basing on concepts of quantum field theory and uniting two main problems, durations of delay at scattering and of formation of arisen states, seems evident.   We show that the Ward-Takahashi identity allows the defining of general temporal function in the frame of QED, real part of which describes the duration of delay of scattered particle on scatterer and imaginary part describes the duration of formation (""dressing"") of outgoing bare particle. The functions of same form can be revealed in the known QED descriptions of processes, i.e. they arise in the course of standard calculations, but are not entered artificially. These functions submit to the operator of duration determinable by the reciprocal analogue of the Schroedinger equation, operator of which is canonically conjugated with Hamiltonian. Definition of temporal functions leads to the developing of such kinetic theories: theory of optical dispersion (with the decision of certain known paradoxes), theory of multiphoton processes (definitions of their thresholds and saturations) and theory of phase transitions (determination of general correlation radii and the full system of critical indices). The determination of temporal functions demonstrates also the instanton-type nature of tunneling processes, makes clear sense of the adiabatic hypothesis of quantum theory and some renormalization schemes. In an application to the problem of charge nullification they lead to a restriction of allowable number of fermions of the theory.

"  We complement our earlier position-space exploration of a recently proposed S-matrix for transplanckian scattering by a momentum-space analysis. As in the previous paper, we restrict ourselves to the case of axisymmetric collisions of extended sources. Comparison between the two formulations allows for several cross-checks while showing their complementary advantages. In particular, the momentum-space formulation leads to an easier computation of the emitted-graviton spectra and to an attempt to study the system beyond its critical points into the presumed gravitational-collapse regime.

"  We demonstrate a one-dimensional magnetic system can exhibit a Cantor-type spectrum using an example of a chain graph with $\delta$ coupling at the vertices exposed to a magnetic field perpendicular to the graph plane and varying along the chain. If the field grows linearly with an irrational slope, measured in terms of the flux through the loops of the chain, we demonstrate the character of the spectrum relating it to the almost Mathieu operator.

"  Dislocations, one-dimensional lattice imperfections, are common to technologically important materials such as III-V semiconductors, and adversely affect heat dissipation in e.g., nitride-based high-power electronic devices. For decades, conventional models based on nonlinear elasticity theory have predicted this thermal resistance is only appreciable when heat flux is perpendicular to the dislocations. However, this dislocation-induced anisotropic thermal transport has yet to be seen experimentally. In this study, we measure strong thermal transport anisotropy governed by highly oriented threading dislocation arrays along the cross-plane direction in micron-thick, single-crystal indium nitride (InN) films. We find that the cross-plane thermal conductivity is more than tenfold higher than the in-plane thermal conductivity at 80 K when the dislocation density is on the order of ~3x10^10 cm^-2. This large anisotropy is not predicted by the conventional models. With enhanced understanding of dislocation-phonon interactions, our results open new regimes for tailoring anisotropic thermal transport with line defects, and will facilitate novel methods for directed heat dissipation in thermal management of diverse device applications.

"  The potential antiproton excess in the AMS-02 data is of much interest and can probably come from dark matter annihilations. Based on the effective field theory approach, in this work we investigate the compatibility of the DM interpretation of the AMS-02 antiproton excess and the null results from direct detection experiments, LUX, PandaX-II, and XENON1T. We focus on dimension-five and -six operators with fermion DM. Only one of dimension-five and one of dimension-six operators can successfully account for the antiproton excess, while the rest either are excluded by direct detection or require very small cut-off scales which invalidate the effective field theory approach.

"  In the Biham-Middleton-Levine traffic model cars are placed with some density p on a two dimensional torus, and move according to a (simple) set of predefined rules. Computer simulations show this system exhibits many interesting phenomena: for low densities the system self organizes such that cars flow freely while for densities higher than some critical density the system gets stuck in an endless traffic jam. However, apart from the simulation results very few properties of the system were proven rigorously to date. We introduce a simplified version of this model in which cars are placed in a single row and column (a junction) and show that similar phenomena of self-organization of the system and phase transition still occur.

"  The undulator is a critical component to produce synchrotron radiation and free electron laser. When a Bessel light beam carrying the orbit angular momentum co-propagates with an electron beam, a net transverse deflection force will be subjected to the electron beam. As a result of dephasing effect, the deflection force will oscillate acting as an undulator. For such a laser based undulator, the period length can reach sub-millimeter level, which will greatly reduce the electron energy for the required X-ray production.

"  Inspired by an old idea of von Neumann, we seek a pair of commuting operators X,P which are, in a specific sense, ""close"" to the canonical non-commuting position and momentum operators, x,p. The construction of such operators is related to the problem of finding complete sets of orthonormal phase space localized states, a problem severely constrained by the Balian-Low theorem. Here these constraints are avoided by restricting attention to situations in which the density matrix is reasonably decohered (i.e., spread out in phase space). Commuting position and momentum operators are argued to be of use in discussions of emergent classicality from quantum mechanics. In particular, they may be used to give a discussion of the relationship between exact and approximate decoherence in the decoherent histories approach to quantum theory.

"  The orbital magnetization of the electron gas on a two-dimensional kagome lattice under a perpendicular magnetic field is theoretically investigated. The interplay between the lattice geometry and magnetic field induce nontrivial $k$-space Chern invariant in the magnetic Brillouin zone, which turns to result in profound effects on the magnetization properties. We show that the Berry-phase term in the magnetization gives a paramagnetic contribution, while the conventional term brought about by the magnetic response of the magnetic Bloch bands produces a diamagnetic contribution. As a result, the superposition of these two components gives rise to a delicate oscillatory structure in the magnetization curve when varying the electron filling factor. The relationship between this oscillatory behavior and the Hofstadter energy spectrum is revealed by selectively discussing the magnetization and its two components at the commensurate fluxes of $f$=1/4, 1/3, and 1/6, respectively. In particular, we reveal as a typical example the fractal structure in the magnetic oscillations by tuning the commensurate flux around $f$=1/4. The finite-temperature effect on the magnetization is also discussed. ",Orbital magnetization of the electron gas on a two-dimensional kagome   lattice under a perpendicular magnetic field
"  We report the observation and systematic investigation of the space charge effect and mirror charge effect in photoemission spectroscopy. When pulsed light is incident on a sample, the photoemitted electrons experience energy redistribution after escaping from the surface because of the Coulomb interaction between them (space charge effect) and between photoemitted electrons and the distribution of mirror charges in the sample (mirror charge effect). These combined Coulomb interaction effects give rise to an energy shift and a broadening which can be on the order of 10 meV for a typical third-generation synchrotron light source. This value is comparable to many fundamental physical parameters actively studied by photoemission spectroscopy and should be taken seriously in interpreting photoemission data and in designing next generation experiments.

"  We study the energy-release process in the confined X1.6 flare that occurred on 22 October 2014 in AR 12192. Magnetic-reconnection rates and reconnection fluxes are derived from three different data sets: space-based data from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) 1600 {\AA} filter onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and ground-based H$\alpha$ and Ca II K filtergrams from Kanzelh\""ohe Observatory. The magnetic-reconnection rates determined from the three data sets all closely resemble the temporal profile of the hard X-rays measured by the Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI), which are a proxy for the flare energy released into high-energy electrons. The total magnetic-reconnection flux derived lies between $4.1 \times 10^{21}$ Mx (AIA 1600 {\AA}) and $7.9 \times 10^{21}$ Mx (H$\alpha$), which corresponds to about 2 to 4% of the total unsigned flux of the strong source AR. Comparison of the magnetic-reconnection flux dependence on the GOES class for 27 eruptive events collected from previous studies (covering B to $>$X10 class flares) reveals a correlation coefficient of $\approx 0.8$ in double-logarithmic space. The confined X1.6 class flare under study lies well within the distribution of the eruptive flares. The event shows a large initial separation of the flare ribbons and no separation motion during the flare. In addition, we note enhanced emission at flare-ribbon structures and hot loops connecting these structures before the event starts. These observations are consistent with the emerging-flux model, where newly emerging small flux tubes reconnect with pre-existing large coronal loops.

"  Continuous change of the propagation direction of a classical control field in the process of its off-resonant Raman interaction with a weak signal field in a three-level atomic medium is suggested for quantum storage of a single-photon wave packet. It is shown that due to phase matching condition such an angular control allows one to reversibly map the single-photon wave packet to the Raman spatial coherence grating. Thus, quantum storage and retrieval can be realized without using inhomogeneous broadening of the atomic transitions or manipulating the amplitude of the control field. Under some conditions the proposed scheme proves to be mathematically analogous to the quantum storage scheme based on controlled reversible inhomogeneous broadening of the atomic states. ",Quantum storage based on the control field angular scanning
"  We investigate the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the supercritical disk accretion flows around black holes by solving the multi-frequency zeroth moment equation of the radiation transfer equation under the flux-limited diffusion approximation as well as the energy equation of gas. Special attention is paid to the photon-trapping effects, the effects that photons are trapped within accretion flow and are swallowed by a black hole, with little being radiated away. It is found that when flow luminosity is below about twice the Eddington luminosity (L<2L_E) photon trapping is ineffective and the SED shifts to the higher-energy side as L increases. The peak frequency at which the SED reaches its peak becomes at maximum three times higher than that given by the standard-disk model, which might resolve the so-called 'too hot accretion disk problem.' When L>2L_E, in contrast the peak frequency of the SED tends to decrease with increase of mass-accretion rate. This is due to enhanced photon-trapping. Since high-energy photons are generated near the equatorial plane, they can be more effectively trapped in flow than low-energy ones and, hence, the high energy part of radiation is suppressed. Finally, the observed time variation of IC 342 S1, which is an ultraluminous X-ray source, in the X-ray HR diagram can be explained by the modulation of the mass accretion rate. In comparison with the observational data, we estimate the mass of black hole in IC 342 S1 is around 100 solar mass.

"  We analyze the morphological transition of a one-dimensional system described by a scalar field, where a flat state looses its stability. This scalar field may for example account for the position of a crystal growth front, an order parameter, or a concentration profile. We show that two types of dynamics occur around the transition: weakly nonlinear dynamics, or highly nonlinear dynamics. The conditions under which highly nonlinear evolution equations appear are determined, and their generic form is derived. Finally, examples are discussed.

"  We present a distributed resource allocation strategy to control an epidemic outbreak in a networked population based on a Distributed Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (D-ADMM) algorithm. We consider a linearized Susceptible- Infected-Susceptible (SIS) epidemic spreading model in which agents in the network are able to allocate vaccination resources (for prevention) and antidotes (for treatment) in the presence of a contagion. We express our epidemic control condition as a spectral constraint involving the Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue, and formulate the resource allocation problem as a Geometric Program (GP). Next, we separate the network-wide optimization problem into subproblems optimally solved by each agent in a fully distributed way. We conclude the paper by illustrating performance of our solution framework with numerical simulations. ",Distributed Resource Allocation for Epidemic control
"  Radio-loud AGNs can inhabit regions with a very rich ISM. The presence of this rich medium is likely related to the origin and evolution of the host galaxy and of the active nucleus. Recent observations show that a large fraction of radio galaxies contains a significant young stellar population. This supports the idea that mergers are responsible for both the starburst phase and the triggering of the nuclear activity. The gas that reaches the central regions can have quite disturbed kinematics, likely due to the effects of the AGN activity and in particular of the powerful radio jets. The recent detection of fast nuclear gas outflows, observed both in ionised and neutral gas, is giving new and important insights into the physical conditions of the gaseous medium around the nucleus and the interaction between the AGN and this medium. Finally, as another example of the interplay between the radio activity and the ISM, the possibility of star formation induced by the passage of the radio jet will be discussed.

"  The recent results from the ATLAS and CMS collaborations show that the allowed range for a Standard Model Higgs boson is now restricted to a very thin region. Although those limits are presented exclusively in the framework of the SM, the searches themselves remain sensitive to other Higgs models. We recast the limits within a generic supersymmetric framework that goes beyond the usual minimal extension. Such a generic model can be parameterised through a supersymmetric effective Lagrangian with higher order operators appearing in the K\""ahler potential and the superpotential, an approach whose first motivation is to alleviate the fine-tuning problem in supersymmetry with the most dramatic consequence being a substantial increase in the mass of the lightest Higgs boson as compared to the minimal supersymmetic model. We investigate in this paper the constraints set by the LHC on such models. We also investigate how the present picture will change when gathering more luminosity. Issues of how to combine and exploit data from the LHC dedicated to searches for the standard model Higgs to such supersymmetry inspired scenarios are discussed. We also discuss the impact of invisible decays of the Higgs in such scenarios. ",SUSY Higgs searches : beyond the MSSM
"  We propose a new caching concept in which wireless nodes in Device-to-Device (D2D) network can cache the initial-segments of the popular video files and may share to users in their proximity upon request. We term this approach as Bootstrapping- D2D (B-D2D) system. Our findings suggest that caching only initial-segments creates a large pool of popular files, thus improving the probability of availability of initial-segments within the vicinity of the requesting users. Our proposed B-D2D system is based on a popular clustering algorithm called density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN), that groups the users into dense and arbitrary shape clusters based on two predefined thresholds. We then formulate an optimization problem to maximize the probability of availability of initial-segments within the transmission range of requesting wireless devices. The simulation results demonstrate that, caching the initial video segments could substantially improve the availability of segments within the proximity of users without requiring any extra hardware infrastructure cost, and D2D services could be utilized to deliver the video contents with lower startup delays in cellular networks.

"  We study dynamics of a QGP fluid induced by energetic partons propagating through it. We construct a (3+1)-dimensional QGP-fluid+Jet model. When a jet traverses a uniform fluid, it induces a Mach cone structure of energy density distribution and a vortex ring surrounding a path of the jet. When a pair of jets travels through a radially expanding fluid, low momentum particles are dominantly induced at large angles from the quenched jet. This result is qualitatively consistent with observation of the CMS Collaboration at LHC. ",Emission of Low Momentum Particles at Large Angles from Jet

"  In a general $L^2$ extension theorem of Demailly for log canonical pairs, the $L^2$ condition with respect to the Ohsawa measure determines when a function can be extended. We give a geometric characterization of this analytic condition in terms of log canonical centers. Moreover, the singularity of the Ohsawa measure is shown to be determined according to subadjunction on each maximal log canonical center with a unique log canonical place. This implies that the $L^2$ condition is essentially equivalent to one that appeared in a previous $L^2$ extension theorem of the author, which enables to combine these results into common generalization/strengthening.

"  We study the nature of tunneling phase time for various quantum mechanical structures such as networks and rings having potential barriers in their arms. We find the generic presence of Hartman effect, with superluminal velocities as a consequence, in these systems. In quantum networks it is possible to control the `super arrival' time in one of the arms by changing the parameters on another arm which is spatially separated from it. This is yet another quantum nonlocal effect. Negative time delays (time advancement) and `ultra Hartman effect' with negative saturation times have been observed in some parameter regimes. In presence and absence of Aharonov-Bohm (AB) flux quantum rings show Hartman effect. We obtain the analytical expression for the saturated phase time. In the opaque barrier regime this is independent of even the AB flux thereby generalizing the Hartman effect. We also briefly discuss the concept of ""space collapse or space destroyer"" by introducing a free space in between two barriers covering the ring. Further we show in presence of absorption the reflection phase time exhibits Hartman effect in contrast to the transmission phase time. ",Phase time for a tunneling particle
"  Asteroseismology of non-radial pulsations in Hot B Subdwarfs (sdB stars) offers a unique view into the interior of core-helium-burning stars. Ground-based and space-borne high precision light curves allow for the analysis of pressure and gravity mode pulsations to probe the structure of sdB stars deep into the convective core. As such asteroseismological analysis provides an excellent opportunity to test our understanding of stellar evolution. In light of the newest constraints from asteroseismology of sdB and red clump stars, standard approaches of convective mixing in 1D stellar evolution models are called into question. The problem lies in the current treatment of overshooting and the entrainment at the convective boundary. Unfortunately no consistent algorithm of convective mixing exists to solve the problem, introducing uncertainties to the estimates of stellar ages. Three dimensional simulations of stellar convection show the natural development of an overshooting region and a boundary layer. In search for a consistent prescription of convection in one dimensional stellar evolution models, guidance from three dimensional simulations and asteroseismological results is indispensable.

"  The next generation of space-based telescopes used for weak lensing surveys will require exquisite point spread function (PSF) determination. Previously negligible effects may become important in the reconstruction of the PSF, in part because of the improved spatial resolution. In this paper, we show that unresolved multiple star systems can affect the ellipticity and size of the PSF and that this effect is not cancelled even when using many stars in the reconstruction process. We estimate the error in the reconstruction of the PSF due to the binaries in the star sample both analytically and with image simulations for different PSFs and stellar populations. The simulations support our analytical finding that the error on the size of the PSF is a function of the multiple stars distribution and of the intrinsic value of the size of the PSF, i.e. if all stars were single. Similarly, the modification of each of the complex ellipticity components (e1,e2) depends on the distribution of multiple stars and on the intrinsic complex ellipticity. Using image simulations, we also show that the predicted error in the PSF shape is a theoretical limit that can be reached only if large number of stars (up to thousands) are used together to build the PSF at any desired spatial position. For a lower number of stars, the PSF reconstruction is worse. Finally, we compute the effect of binarity for different stellar magnitudes and show that bright stars alter the PSF size and ellipticity more than faint stars. This may affect the design of PSF calibration strategies and the choice of the related calibration fields.

"  The PAWN index is gaining traction among the modelling community as a sensitivity measure. However, the robustness to its design parameters has not yet been scrutinized: the size ($N$) and sampling ($\varepsilon$) of the model output, the number of conditioning intervals ($n$) or the summary statistic ($\theta$). Here we fill this gap by running a sensitivity analysis of a PAWN-based sensitivity analysis. We compare the results with the design uncertainties of the Sobol' total-order index ($S_{Ti}^*$). Unlike in $S_{Ti}^*$, the design uncertainties in PAWN create non-negligible chances of producing biased results when ranking or screening inputs. The dependence of PAWN upon ($N,n,\varepsilon, \theta$) is difficult to tame, as these parameters interact with one another. Even in an ideal setting in which the optimum choice for ($N,n,\varepsilon, \theta$) is known in advance, PAWN might not allow to distinguish an influential, non-additive model input from a truly non-influential model input.

"  A low matter density decaying vacuum cosmology is proposed on the assumption that the universe's radius is a complex quantity \hat{R} if it is regarded as having a zero energy-momentum tensor. But we find that when the radius is real, it contains matter. Using the Einstein-Hilbert action principle, the physical scale factor R(t) =|\hat{R}| is obtained as equal to (R_0^{2} + t^{2})^{1/2} with R_0 representing the finite radius of the universe at t=0. The resulting physical picture is roughly a theoretical justification of the old Ozer-Taha model. The new model is devoid of all cosmological problems. In particular, it confirms the bounds on H_p, the present value of the Hubble parameter: 0.85 < H_p t_p < 1.91 and faces no age problem. We argue that the total energy density consists of parts corresponding to relativistic/non-relativistic matter, a positive vacuum energy and a form of matter with equation of state p_K = -(1/3) rho_K (textures or generally K-matter), and the following predictions are made for the present nonrelativistic era: Omega_{M,n.rel.} \approx 2/3, Omega_{V,n.rel.} \approx 1/3, Omega_ <<1, Omega_K \approx 1, where a parameter corresponding to K-matter is taken to be unity. It is shown that the spacetime with complex metric has signature changing properties. Using quantum cosmological considerations, it is shown that the wave function is peaked about the classical contour of evolution and the minimum radius R_0 of the nonsingular model is predicted as comparable with the Planck length.

"  We have studied the interplay of valley polarization and the Coulomb interaction on the energy spectrum, persistent current, and optical absorption of a graphene quantum ring. We show that the interaction has a dramatic effect on the nature of the ground state as a function of the magnetic flux, and that the absence of the exchange interaction in opposite valleys means that the singlet-triplet degeneracy is not lifted for certain states. The additional level crossings (fractional flux periodicity) due to the interaction directly leads to extra steps in the persistent current and intricate structures in the absorption spectrum that should be experimentally observable. By varying the width of the ring, the nature of the ground state at zero field can be varied as well and this is manifest in the measurable properties we discuss.

Furthermore, we prove that Mukai varieties of genus $g \in \{7,8,9,10\}$ and dimension $n \ge 5$ contain cylinders if they have a $\mathsf{k}$-point. Finally, we prove that the embedding $X \hookrightarrow \mathrm{Gr}(3,7)$ for prime Fano threefolds of genus $12$ is defined canonically over any field and use this to give a new proof of the criterion of rationality.

"  Bifacial solar panels are perceived to be the technology of choice for next generation solar farms for their increased energy yield at marginally increased cost. As the bifacial farms proliferate around the world, it is important to investigate the role of temperature-dependent energy-yield and levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of bifacial solar farms relative to monofacial farms, stand-alone bifacial modules, and various competing bifacial technologies. In this work, we integrate irradiance and light collection models with experimentally validated, physics-based temperature-dependent efficiency models to compare the energy yield and LCOE reduction of various bifacial technologies across the world. We find that temperature-dependent efficiency changes the energy yield and LCOE by approximately -10 to 15%. Indeed, the results differ significantly depending on the location of the farm (which defines the illumination and ambient temperature), elevation of the module (increases incident energy), as well as the temperature-coefficients of various bifacial technologies. The analysis presented in this paper will allow us to realistically assess location-specific relative advantage and economic viability of the next generation bifacial solar farms.

"  Vafa-Witten (VW) theory is a topologically twisted version of N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. S-duality suggests that the partition function of VW theory with gauge group SU(N) transforms as a modular form under duality transformations. Interestingly, Vafa and Witten demonstrated the presence of a modular anomaly, when the theory has gauge group SU(2) and is considered on the complex projective plane P2. This modular anomaly could be expressed as an integral of a modular form, and also be traded for a holomorphic anomaly. We demonstrate that the modular anomaly for gauge group SU(3) involves an iterated integral of modular forms. Moreover, the modular anomaly for SU(3) can be traded for a holomorphic anomaly, which is shown to factor into a product of the partition functions for lower rank gauge groups. The SU(3) partition function is mathematically an example of a mock modular form of depth two. ",Vafa-Witten theory and iterated integrals of modular forms

"  Theorem provers has been used extensively in software engineering for software testing or verification. However, software is now so large and complex that additional architecture is needed to guide theorem provers as they try to generate test suites. The SNAP test suite generator (introduced in this paper) combines the Z3 theorem prover with the following tactic: cluster some candidate tests, then search for valid tests by proposing small mutations to the cluster centroids. This technique effectively removes repeated structures in the tests since many repeated structures can be replaced with one centroid. In practice, SNAP is remarkably effective. For 27 real-world programs with up to half a million variables, SNAP found test suites which were 10 to 750 smaller times than those found by the prior state-of-the-art.

We investigate this premise by including a canonical SU(2) Yang-Mills field to the total energy budget of the universe coupled to the standard quintessential field by a disformal transformation. The background dynamics study is addressed by a dynamical system analysis from which novel anisotropic scaling solutions with a non-vanishing gauge field, supporting a preferred spatial direction, are obtained. After establishing the dynamical character of the fixed points, the phenomenological consequences of the model on the background evolution of the universe are assessed by means of numerical analysis. As an interesting result, the disformal coupling changes the equation of state of the gauge field from radiation to matter at some stages of the evolution of the universe, thereby the gauge field can contribute to some fraction of the total dark matter. We have also quantified the redshift-dependent contribution of the gauge field in the form of dark radiation during the radiation era to the effective number of relativistic species. This depends essentially on the initial conditions and, more importantly, on the disformal coupling function. Phenomenological couplings and the Abelian version of the model are discussed in order to check the generality of our results. Finally, the phenomenological advantages of this model are discussed in the light of the current tensions in the $\Lambda$CDM model.

"  The difference between Lorentz invariance and Lorentz covariance is discussed in detail. A covariant formalism is developed for the internal space-time symmetry of extended particles, especially in connection with the insightful observations Feynman made during the period 1969-72. A Lorentz-group formalism is presented for the harmonic oscillator model of Feynman, Kislinger and Ravndal, which was originally based on hadronic mass spectra. This covariant version allows us to construct a parton distribution function by Lorentz-boosting the oscillator wave function of a hadron at rest. The role of the time-separation variable is discussed in detail. It is shown that, due to our inability to make measurements on this variable, it belongs to Feynman's rest of the universe. Our failure to observe the rest of the universe leads to an increase in entropy. ",Lorentz Covariance and Internal Space-time Symmetry of Relativistic   Extended Particles
"  The Painlev\'e paradox is a phenomenon that causes instability in mechanical systems subjects to unilateral constraints. While earlier studies were mostly focused on abstract theoretical settings, recent work confirmed the occurrence of the paradox in realistic set-ups. In this paper, we investigate the dynamics and presence of the Painlev\'e phenomenon in a twolinks robot in contact with a moving belt, through a bifurcation study. Then, we use the results of this analysis to inform the design of control strategies able to keep the robot sliding on the belt and avoid the onset of undesired lift-off. To this aim, through numerical simulations, we synthesise and compare a PID strategy and a hybrid force/motion control scheme, finding that the latter is able to guarantee better performance and avoid the onset of bouncing motion due to the Painlev\'e phenomenon.

"  The spectrum of zero-point radiation is relativistically invariant and its spectral density function is therefore inversely proportional to the cubes of its wavelengths. For its energy to be finite, there must exist a minimum wavelength, $q_\lambda$. The measurements of the apparent attraction between two uncharged conductor plates, placed in a vacuum at a temperature close to absolute zero, made by Sparnaay in 1958 allow us to deduce that the energy flow of the zero-point radiation which comes of or into an area $(q_\lambda)^2$, corresponds with the emission of one photon of wavelength $q_\lambda$ per $q_\tau$ $(q_\tau=q_\lambda/c)$, plus one photon of wavelength $2q_\lambda$ per $2^3q_\tau$, etc., up to one photon of wavelength $nq_\lambda$ per $n^3q_\tau$. This energy flow is enormous, but Sparnaay's experiments implied only photons whose wavelengths were greater than $5\times10^{-5}$ cm, and zero-point radiation may include only photons with wavelengths greater than $xq_\lambda$, being $x$ an integer, perhaps very great.

"  Terrestrial Solar System planets either have high mean molecular weight atmospheres, as with Venus, Mars, and Earth, or no atmosphere at all, as with Mercury. We do not have sufficient observational information to know if this is typical of terrestrial planets or a phenomenon unique to the Solar System. The bulk of atmospheric exoplanet studies have focused on hot Jupiters and Neptunes, but recent discoveries of small, rocky exoplanets transiting small, nearby stars provide targets that are amenable to atmospheric study. GJ 1132b has a radius of 1.2 Earth radii and a mass of 1.6 Earth masses, and orbits an M-dwarf 12 parsecs away from the Solar System. We present results from five transits of GJ 1132b taken with the Magellan Clay Telescope and the LDSS3C multi-object spectrograph. We jointly fit our five data sets when determining the best-fit transit parameters both for the white light curve and wavelength-binned light curves. We bin the light curves into 20 nm wavelength bands to construct the transmission spectrum. Our results disfavor a clear, 10x solar metallicity atmosphere at 3.7 sigma confidence and a 10% H2O, 90% H2 atmosphere at 3.5 sigma confidence. Our data are consistent with a featureless spectrum, implying that GJ 1132b has a high mean molecular weight atmosphere or no atmosphere at all, though we do not account for the possible presence of aerosols. This result is in agreement with theoretical work which suggests that a planet of GJ 1132b's mass and insolation should not be able to retain a H2 envelope.

"  Saturn's ionosphere is produced when the otherwise neutral atmosphere is exposed to a flow of energetic charged particles or solar radiation. At low latitudes the latter should result in a weak planet-wide glow in infrared (IR), corresponding to the planet's uniform illumination by the Sun. The observed low-latitude ionospheric electron density is lower and the temperature higher than predicted by models. A planet-ring magnetic connection has been previously suggested in which an influx of water from the rings could explain the lower than expected electron densities in Saturn's atmosphere. Here we report the detection of a pattern of features, extending across a broad latitude band from ~25 to 60 degrees, that is superposed on the lower latitude background glow, with peaks in emission that map along the planet's magnetic field lines to gaps in Saturn's rings. This pattern implies the transfer of charged water products from the ring-plane to the ionosphere, revealing the influx on a global scale, flooding between 30 to 43% of the planet's upper-atmospheric surface. This ring `rain' plays a fundamental role in modulating ionospheric emissions and suppressing electron densities. ",The domination of Saturn's low latitude ionosphere by ring `rain'
"  We present a new way of testing ordered hypotheses against all alternatives which overpowers the classical approach both in simplicity and statistical power. Our new method tests the constrained likelihood ratio statistic against the quantile of one and only one chi-squared random variable with a data-dependent degrees of freedom instead of a mixture of chi-squares. Our new test is proved to have a valid finite-sample significance level $\alpha$ and provides more power especially for sparse alternatives (those with a few or moderate number of null constraints violations) in comparison to the classical approach. Our method is also easier to use than the classical approach which requires to calculate or simulate a set of complicated weights. Two special cases are considered with more details, namely the case of testing orthants $\mu_1<0, \cdots, \mu_n<0$ and the isotonic case of testing $\mu_1<\mu_2<\mu_3$ against all alternatives. Contours of the difference in power are shown for these examples showing the interest of our new approach. ",Adaptive Critical Value for Constrained Likelihood Ratio Testing

"  Let G be a split semisimple algebraic group with trivial center. Let S be a compact oriented surface, with or without boundary. We define {\it positive} representations of the fundamental group of S to G(R), construct explicitly all positive representations, and prove that they are faithful, discrete, and positive hyperbolic; the moduli space of positive representations is a topologically trivial open domain in the space of all representations.   When S have holes, we defined two moduli spaces closely related to the moduli spaces of G-local systems on S. We show that they carry a lot of interesting structures. In particular we define a distinguished collection of coordinate systems, equivariant under the action of the mapping class group of S. We prove that their transition functions are subtraction free. Thus we have positive structures on these moduli spaces. Therefore we can take their points with values in any positive semifield. Their positive real points provide the two higher Teichmuller spaces related to G and S, while the points with values in the tropical semifields provide the lamination spaces. We define the motivic avatar of the Weil-Petersson form for one of these spaces. It is related to the motivic dilogarithm. ",Moduli spaces of local systems and higher Teichmuller theory
"  We develop a multi-kernel based regression method for graph signal processing where the target signal is assumed to be smooth over a graph.

We estimate the linear weights to learn the effective kernel function by appropriate regularization based on graph smoothness. We show that the resulting optimization problem is shown to be convex and pro- pose an accelerated projected gradient descent based solution. Simulation results using real-world graph signals show efficiency of the multi-kernel based approach over a standard kernel based approach. ",Multi-kernel Regression For Graph Signal Processing

It has been claimed, in a recent set of papers, that the co-BRST symmetries are not independent of the BRST symmetries. We show that the BRST and co-BRST symmetries are independent symmetries in the same fashion as the exterior and co-exterior derivatives are independent entities belonging to the set of de Rham cohomological operators of differential geometry.

We present new estimates on the energy dissipation rate and we discuss applications to the study of upper bounds on the enhancing dissipation rate, lower bounds on the $L^2$ norm of the density, and quantitative vanishing viscosity estimates. The key tools employed in our argument are a propagation of regularity result, coming from the study of transport equations, and a new result connecting the energy dissipation rate to regularity estimates for transport equations. Eventually we provide examples which underline the sharpness of our estimates. ",Advection diffusion equations with Sobolev velocity field
"  In this paper, we first remodel the line coverage as a 1D discrete problem with co-linear targets. Then, an order-based greedy algorithm, called OGA, is proposed to solve the problem optimally. It will be shown that the existing order in the 1D modeling, and especially the resulted Markov property of the selected sensors can help design greedy algorithms such as OGA. These algorithms demonstrate optimal/efficient performance and have lower complexity compared to the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the conventional continuous line coverage problem can be converted to an equivalent discrete problem and solved optimally by OGA. Next, we formulate the well-known weak barrier coverage problem as an instance of the continuous line coverage problem (i.e. a 1D problem) as opposed to the conventional 2D graph-based models. We demonstrate that the equivalent discrete version of this problem can be solved optimally and faster than the state-of-the-art methods using an extended version of OGA, called K-OGA. Moreover, an efficient local algorithm, called LOGM, is proposed to mend barrier gaps due to sensor failure. In the case of m gaps, LOGM is proved to select at most 2m-1 sensors more than the optimal while being local and implementable in distributed fashion. We demonstrate the optimal/efficient performance of the proposed algorithms via extensive simulations.

"  Scalable substitutional doping of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) is a prerequisite to developing next-generation logic and memory devices based on 2D materials. To date, doping efforts are still nascent. Here, we report scalable growth and vanadium (V) doping of 2D WSe2 at front-end-of-line (FEOL) and back-end-of-line (BEOL) compatible temperatures of 800 {\deg}C and 400 {\deg}C, respectively. A combination of experimental and theoretical studies confirm that vanadium atoms substitutionally replace tungsten in WSe2, which results in p-type doping via the introduction of discrete defect levels that lie close to the valence band maxima. The p-type nature of the V dopants is further verified by constructed field-effect transistors, where hole conduction becomes dominant with increasing vanadium concentration. Hence, our study presents a method to precisely control the density of intentionally introduced impurities, which is indispensable in the production of electronic-grade wafer-scale extrinsic 2D semiconductors.

"  The fluctuation-response relation is a fundamental relation that is applicable to systems near equilibrium. On the other hand, when a system is driven far from equilibrium, this relation is violated in general because the detailed-balance condition is not satisfied in nonequilibrium systems. Even in this case, it has been found that for a class of Langevin equations, there exists an equality between the extent of violation of the fluctuation-response relation in the nonequilibrium steady state and the rate of energy dissipation from the system into the environment [T. Harada and S. -i. Sasa, Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 130602 (2005)]. Since this equality involves only experimentally measurable quantities, it serves as a proposition to determine experimentally whether the system can be described by a Langevin equation. Furthermore, the contribution of each degree of freedom to the rate of energy dissipation can be determined based on this equality. In this paper, we present a comprehensive description on this equality, and provide a detailed derivation for various types of models including many-body systems, Brownian motor models, time-dependent systems, and systems with multiple heat reservoirs.

"  Consider the class of n-dimensional Riemannian spin manifolds with bounded sectional curvatures and diameter, and almost non-negative scalar curvature. Let r=1 if n=2,3 and r=2^{[n/2]-1}+1 if n\geq 4. We show that if the square of the Dirac operator on such a manifold has $r$ small eigenvalues, then the manifold is diffeomorphic to a nilmanifold and has trivial spin structure. Equivalently, if M is not a nilmanifold or if M is a nilmanifold with a non-trivial spin structure, then there exists a uniform lower bound on the r-th eigenvalue of the square of the Dirac operator. If a manifold with almost nonnegative scalar curvature has one small Dirac eigenvalue, and if the volume is not too small, then we show that the metric is close to a Ricci-flat metric on M with a parallel spinor. In dimension 4 this implies that M is either a torus or a K3-surface. ",Manifolds with small Dirac eigenvalues are nilmanifolds
"  This work addresses the unsupervised domain adaptation problem, especially in the case of class labels in the target domain being only a subset of those in the source domain. Such a partial transfer setting is realistic but challenging and existing methods always suffer from two key problems, negative transfer and uncertainty propagation. In this paper, we build on domain adversarial learning and propose a novel domain adaptation method BA$^3$US with two new techniques termed Balanced Adversarial Alignment (BAA) and Adaptive Uncertainty Suppression (AUS), respectively. On one hand, negative transfer results in misclassification of target samples to the classes only present in the source domain. To address this issue, BAA pursues the balance between label distributions across domains in a fairly simple manner. Specifically, it randomly leverages a few source samples to augment the smaller target domain during domain alignment so that classes in different domains are symmetric. On the other hand, a source sample would be denoted as uncertain if there is an incorrect class that has a relatively high prediction score, and such uncertainty easily propagates to unlabeled target data around it during alignment, which severely deteriorates adaptation performance. Thus we present AUS that emphasizes uncertain samples and exploits an adaptive weighted complement entropy objective to encourage incorrect classes to have uniform and low prediction scores. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate our BA$^3$US surpasses state-of-the-arts for partial domain adaptation tasks. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/tim-learn/BA3US}.

"  This paper continues earlier work and is concerned with the inverse problem of parameter identification in variational inequalities of the second kind that does not only treat the parameter linked to a bilinear form, but importantly also the parameter linked to a nonlinear non-smooth function. The optimization approach in the earlier work on the inverse problem using the output-least squares formulation involves the variational inequality of the second kind as constraint. Here we use regularization technics of nondifferentiable optimization, regularize the nonsmooth part in the variational inequality and arrive at an optimization problem for which the constraint variational inequality is replaced by the regularized variational equation. For this case, the smoothness of the parameter-to-solution map is studied and convergence analysis and optimality conditions are given.

"  We show how the model of pseudo-complex general relativity can be tested using gravitational wave signals from coalescing compact objects. The model, which agrees with Einstein gravity in the weak-field limit, diverges dramatically in the near-horizon regime, with certain parameter ranges excluding the existence of black holes. We show that simple limits can be placed on the model in both the inspiral and ringdown phase of coalescing compact objects. We discuss further how these bounds relate to current observational limits. In particular, for minimal scenarios previously considered in the literature, gravitational wave observations are able to constrain pseudo-complex general relativity parameters to values that require the existence of black hole horizons.

"  Cooperation is prevalent in nature, not only in the context of social interactions within the animal kingdom, but also on the cellular level. In cancer for example, tumour cells can cooperate by producing growth factors. The evolution of cooperation has traditionally been studied for well-mixed populations under the framework of evolutionary game theory, and more recently for structured populations using evolutionary graph theory. The population structures arising due to cellular arrangement in tissues however are dynamic and thus cannot be accurately represented by either of these frameworks. In this work we compare the conditions for cooperative success in an epithelium modelled using evolutionary graph theory, to those in a mechanical model of an epithelium =- the Voronoi tessellation model. Crucially, in this latter model cells are able to move, and birth and death are not spatially coupled. We calculate fixation probabilities in the Voronoi tessellation model through simulation and an approximate analytic technique and show that this leads to stronger promotion of cooperation in comparison with the evolutionary graph theory model.

"  In this paper, we study the problem of dynamic channel allocation for URLLC traffic in a multi-user multi-channel wireless network where urgent packets have to be successfully transmitted in a timely manner. We formulate the problem as a finite-horizon Markov Decision Process with a stochastic constraint related to the QoS requirement, defined as the packet loss rate for each user. We propose a novel weighted formulation that takes into account both the total expected reward (number of successfully transmitted packets) and the risk which we define as the QoS requirement violation. First, we use the value iteration algorithm to find the optimal policy, which assumes a perfect knowledge of the controller of all the parameters, namely the channel statistics. We then propose a Q-learning algorithm where the controller learns the optimal policy without having knowledge of neither the CSI nor the channel statistics. We illustrate the performance of our algorithms with numerical studies. ",Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement Learning for URLLC Traffic in Wireless   Networks
"  Many algorithms use concrete data types with some additional invariants. The set of values satisfying the invariants is often a set of representatives for the equivalence classes of some equational theory. For instance, a sorted list is a particular representative wrt commutativity. Theories like associativity, neutral element, idempotence, etc. are also very common. Now, when one wants to combine various invariants, it may be difficult to find the suitable representatives and to efficiently implement the invariants. The preservation of invariants throughout the whole program is even more difficult and error prone. Classically, the programmer solves this problem using a combination of two techniques: the definition of appropriate construction functions for the representatives and the consistent usage of these functions ensured via compiler verifications. The common way of ensuring consistency is to use an abstract data type for the representatives; unfortunately, pattern matching on representatives is lost. A more appealing alternative is to define a concrete data type with private constructors so that both compiler verification and pattern matching on representatives are granted. In this paper, we detail the notion of private data type and study the existence of construction functions. We also describe a prototype, called Moca, that addresses the entire problem of...

We study in detail the process of vacuum creation of vector bosons generated by a time-dependent boson mass in accordance with a conformal-invariant scalar-tensor gravitational theory and its cosmological application. It is indicated that the choice of the equation of state (EoS) of the Universe allows to obtain a number density of the vector bosons that is sufficient to explain the observed number density of photons in the cosmic microwave background radiation. It is shown that the vector boson gas created from the vacuum is in a strong non-equilibrium state and corresponds to a cold dust-like EoS.

"  Contrary to the common perception, we show that the current Higgs data does not eliminate the possibility of a sequential fourth generation that get their masses through the same Higgs mechanism as the first three generations. The inability to fix the sign of the bottom-quark Yukawa coupling from the available data plays a crucial role in accommodating a chiral fourth generation which is consistent with the bounds on the Higgs signal strengths. We show that effects of such a fourth generation can remain completely hidden not only in the production of the Higgs boson through gluon fusion but also to its subsequent decay to $\gamma\gamma$ and $ Z\gamma$. This, however, is feasible only if the scalar sector of the Standard Model is extended. We also provide a practical example illustrating how our general prescription can be embedded in a realistic model.

"  We investigate the ground state properties of the spin-$1/2$ pyrochlore Heisenberg antiferromagnet using pseudofermion functional renormalization group techniques. The first part of our analysis is based on an enhanced parton mean-field approach which takes into account fluctuation effects from renormalized vertex functions. Our implementation of this technique extends earlier approaches and resolves technical difficulties associated with a diagrammatic overcounting. Using various parton ans\""atze for quantum spin liquids, dimerized and nematic states our results indicate a tendency for lattice symmetry breaking in the ground state. While overall quantum spin liquids seem unfavorable in this system, the recently proposed monopole state still shows the strongest support among all spin liquid ans\""atze that we have tested, which is further confirmed by our complementary variational Monte Carlo calculations. In the second part of our investigation, we probe lattice symmetry breaking more directly by applying the pseudofermion functional renormalization group to perturbed systems. Our results from this technique confirm that the system's ground state either exhibits broken $C_3$ rotation symmetry, or a combination of inversion and $C_3$ symmetry breaking.

The interaction between oriented molecule materials, which are regarded as anisotropic chiral media, and metallic nanostructures has been investigated. Our results show that the plasmon-induced CD is sensitive to the orientations of the molecules. In many cases, the contribution of molecular electric quadrupole transitions to the total CD signal can play a key role. More interesting, we have demonstrated that both the quadrupole- and dipole-based CD signals can be improved greatly by matching the phases for the electromagnetic fields and their gradients at different regions around the nanostructures, which are occupied by the oriented chiral molecules. Different regions might produce CD of opposite sign. When integrating over regions with only one side of the proposed nanostructure, we find that the CD-peak may be nearly hundreds-fold over the case of integrating both sides. We believe that these findings would be helpful for realizing ultrasensitive probing of chiral information for oriented molecules by plasmon-based nanotechnology.

"  In this paper, we consider the perturbed Laguerre unitary ensemble described by the weight function of $$w(x,t)=(x+t)^{\lambda}x^{\alpha}e^{-x}$$ with $ x\geq 0,\ t>0,\ \alpha>0,\ \alpha+\lambda+1 > 0.$ The Deift-Zhou nonlinear steepest descent approach is used to analyze the limit of the eigenvalue correlation kernel. It was found that under the double scaling $s=4nt,$ $n\to \infty,$ $t\to 0 $ such that $s$ is positive and finite, at the hard edge, the limiting kernel can be described by the $\varphi$-function related to a third-order nonlinear differential equation, which is equivalent to a particular Painlev\'e V (shorted as P$_{\rm V}$) transcendent via a simple transformation. Moreover, this P$_{\rm V}$ transcendent is equivalent to a general Painlev\'e P$_{\rm III}$ transcendent. For large $s,$ the P$_{\rm V}$ kernel reduces to the Bessel kernel $\mathbf{J}_{\alpha+\lambda}.$ For small $s,$ the P$_{\rm V}$ kernel reduces to another Bessel kernel $\mathbf{J}_\alpha.$ At the soft edge, the limiting kernel is the Airy kernel as the classical Laguerre weight.

"  Context. The formation of vortices in accretion disks is of high interest in various astrophysical contexts, in particular for planet formation or in the disks of compact objects. But despite numerous attempts it has thus far not been possible to produce strong vortices in fully three-dimensional simulations of disks. Aims. The aim of this paper is to present the first 3D simulation of a strong vortex, established across the vertically stratified structure of a disk by the Rossby Wave Instability. Methods. Using the Versatile Advection Code (VAC), we set up a fully 3D cylindrical stratified disk potentially prone to the Rossby Wave Instability. Results. The simulation confirms the basic expectations obtained from previous 2D analytic and numerical works. The simulation exhibits a strong vortex that grows rapidly and saturates at a finite amplitude. On the other hand the third dimension shows unexpected additional behaviours that could be of strong importance in the astrophysical roles that such vortices can play.

"  In this work we study the dynamics of the Local Group (LG) within the context of cosmological models beyond General Relativity (GR). Using observable kinematic quantities to identify candidate pairs we build up samples of simulated LG-like objects drawing from $f(R)$, symmetron, DGP and quintessence N-body simulations together with their $\Lambda$CDM counterparts featuring the same initial random phase realisations. The variables and intervals used to define LG-like objects are referred to as Local Group model; different models are used throughout this work and adapted to study their dynamical and kinematic properties. The aim is to determine how well the observed LG-dynamics can be reproduced within cosmological theories beyond GR, We compute kinematic properties of samples drawn from alternative theories and $\Lambda$CDM and compare them to actual observations of the LG mass, velocity and position. As a consequence of the additional pull, pairwise tangential and radial velocities are enhanced in modified gravity and coupled dark energy with respect to $\Lambda$CDM, inducing significant changes to the total angular momentum and energy of the LG. For example, in models such as $f(R)$ and the symmetron this increase can be as large as $60\%$, peaking well outside of the $95\%$ confidence region allowed by the data. This shows how simple considerations about the LG dynamics can lead to clear small-scale observational signatures for alternative scenarios, without the need of expensive high-resolution simulations.

"  We study the spin-dependent scattering of charge carriers in a magnetized one dimensional Luttinger liquid from a localized non-homogeneous magnetic field, which might be brought about by the stray field of magnetic tip near a uniform liquid, or by a transverse domain wall (DW) between two oppositely magnetized liquids.   From a renormalization group treatment of the electron interactions we deduce scaling equations for the transmission and reflection amplitudes as the bandwidth is progressively reduced to an energy scale set by the temperature. The repulsive interactions dictate two possible zero temperature insulator fixed points: one in which electrons are reflected in the same spin channel and another where the electron spin is reversed upon reflection. In the latter case, a finite spin current emerges in the absence of a charge current at zero temperature and the Friedel oscillations form a transverse spiraling spin density. Adding a purely potential scattering term has no effect on the fixed points of a uniformly magnetized liquid. For a DW we find that the introduction of potential scattering stabilizes the spin-flip insulator phase even if the single-particle spin-flip scattering produced by the DW is arbitrarily weak. The potential can be induced externally, e.g. by a local gate voltage or a constriction, providing a means for controlling the transport properties of the wire.

"  The Partitioned Global Address Space (PGAS) programming model strikes a balance between the locality-aware, but explicit, message-passing model and the easy-to-use, but locality-agnostic, shared memory model. However, the PGAS rich memory model comes at a performance cost which can hinder its potential for scalability and performance. To contain this overhead and achieve full performance, compiler optimizations may not be sufficient and manual optimizations are typically added. This, however, can severely limit the productivity advantage. Such optimizations are usually targeted at reducing address translation overheads for shared data structures. This paper proposes a hardware architectural support for PGAS, which allows the processor to efficiently handle shared addresses. This eliminates the need for such hand-tuning, while maintaining the performance and productivity of PGAS languages. We propose to avail this hardware support to compilers by introducing new instructions to efficiently access and traverse the PGAS memory space. A prototype compiler is realized by extending the Berkeley Unified Parallel C (UPC) compiler. It allows unmodified code to use the new instructions without the user intervention, thereby creating a real productive programming environment. Two implementations are realized: the first is implemented using the full system simulator Gem5, which allows the evaluation of the performance gain. The second is implemented using a softcore processor Leon3 on an FPGA to verify the implementability and to parameterize the cost of the new hardware and its instructions. The new instructions show promising results for the NAS Parallel Benchmarks implemented in UPC. A speedup of up to 5.5x is demonstrated for unmodified and unoptimized codes. Unoptimized code performance using this hardware was shown to also surpass the performance of manually optimized code by up to 10%.

"  Noise is the price to pay when trying to clone or amplify arbitrary quantum states. The quantum noise associated to linear phase-insensitive amplifiers can only be avoided by relaxing the requirement of a deterministic operation. Here we present the experimental realization of a probabilistic noiseless linear amplifier that is able to amplify coherent states at the highest level of effective gain and final state fidelity ever reached. Based on a sequence of photon addition and subtraction, and characterized by a significant amplification and low distortions, this high-fidelity amplification scheme may become an essential tool for quantum communications and metrology, by enhancing the discrimination between partially overlapping quantum states or by recovering the information transmitted over lossy channels.

"  For a newform $f=\sum a_n q^n$ of weight $k \geq 3$ and a prime $\lambda$ of $\mathbf{Q}(a_n)$, the deformation problem for its associated mod $\lambda$ Galois representation is unobstructed for all primes outside some finite set. Previous results gave an explicit bound on this finite set for $f$ of squarefree level; we modify this bound and remove the squarefree hypothesis. We also show that if the $\lambda$-adic deformation problem for $f$ is unobstructed, then $f$ is not congruent mod $\lambda$ to a newform of lower level.

  A common approach to detect multiple changepoints is to minimise a measure of data fit plus a penalty that is linear in the number of changepoints. This paper shows that the general finite sample behaviour of such a method can be related to its behaviour when analysing data with either none or one changepoint. This results in simpler conditions for verifying whether the method will consistently estimate the number and locations of the changepoints. We apply and demonstrate the usefulness of this result for a range of changepoint problems. Our new results include a weaker condition on the choice of penalty required to have consistency in a change-in-slope model; and the first results for the accuracy of recently-proposed methods for detecting spikes. ,Consistency of a range of penalised cost approaches for detecting   multiple changepoints
"  Proton-proton fusion is considered in the effective field theory of Kaplan, Savage and Wise. Coulomb effects are included systematically in a non-perturbative way. Including the dimension-eight derivative coupling which determines the effective ranges of the scattering amplitudes, next-to-leading order corrections to the fusion rate are calculated. When the renormalization mass is well above the characteristic energies of the system, this contribution gives a rate which is eight percent below the standard value. The difference can be due to an unknown counterterm which comes in at this order. ",Effective-Range Corrections to the Proton-Proton Fusion Rate

"  Let (E,H,mu) be an abstract Wiener space and let D_V := VD, where D denotes the Malliavin derivative and V is a closed and densely defined operator from H into another Hilbert space G. Given a bounded operator B on G, coercive on the closure of the range of V, we consider the realisation of the operator D_V* B D_V in L^p(E,mu) for 1<p<\infty. Our main result states that the following assertions are equivalent:   (1) dom((sqrt(D_V* B D_V)) = dom(D_V) and Meyer's inequalities hold for D_V* B D_V;   (2) D_V D_V* B admits a bounded H-infinity calculus on the closure of the range of D_V;   (3) dom(sqrt(V*BV)) = dom(V) and Meyer's inequalities hold for V*BV;   (4) VV*B admits a bounded H-infinity calculus on the closure of the range of V.   Moreover, if these conditions are satisfied, then dom(L) = dom(D_V^2) \cap dom(D_A). The equivalence of (1)-(4) is a non-symmetric generalisation of the classical Meyer inequalities (which correspond to the case G=H, V=I, B=I). A one-sided version of the main result, giving L^p-boundedness of the associated Riesz transforms in terms of a square function estimate, is also obtained.   As an application let -A generate an analytic C_0-contraction semigroup on a Hilbert space H and let -L be the L^p-realisation of the generator of its second quantisation.

"  HI in galaxies traces the fuel for future star formation and reveals the effects of feedback on neutral gas. Using a statistically uniform, HI-selected sample of 565 galaxies from the ALFALFA H-alpha survey, we explore HI properties as a function of star formation activity. ALFALFA H-alpha provides R-band and H-alpha imaging for a volume-limited subset of the 21-cm ALFALFA survey. We identify eight starbursts based on H-alpha equivalent width and six with enhanced star formation relative to the main sequence. Both starbursts and non-starbursts have similar HI to stellar mass ratios (MHI/M*), which suggests that feedback is not depleting the starbursts' HI. Consequently, the starbursts do have shorter HI depletion times (t_dep), implying more efficient HI-to-H2 conversion. While major mergers likely drive this enhanced efficiency in some starbursts, the lowest mass starbursts may experience periodic bursts, consistent with enhanced scatter in t_dep at low M*. Two starbursts appear to be pre-coalescence mergers; their elevated MHI/M* suggest that HI-to-H2 conversion is still ongoing at this stage. By comparing with the GASS sample, we find that t_dep anti-correlates with stellar surface density for disks, while spheroids show no such trend. Among early-type galaxies, t_dep does not correlate with bulge-to-disk ratio; instead, the gas distribution may determine the star formation efficiency. Finally, the weak connection between galaxies' specific star formation rates and MHI/M* contrasts with the well-known correlation between MHI/M* and color. We show that dust extinction can explain the HI-color trend, which may arise from the relationship between M*, MHI, and metallicity.

"  One of the important microlensing applications to stellar atmospheres is the study of spots on stellar surface provided by the high resolution of caustic-crossing binary-lens events. In this paper, we investigate the characteristics of spot-induced perturbations in microlensing light curves and explain the physical background of the characteristics. We explore the variation of the spot-induced perturbations depending on various parameters characterizing the spot and investigate how well these parameters can be retrieved from observations in high-cadence future lensing surveys. From this, we find that although it would not be easy to precisely constrain the shape and the surface brightness contrast, the size and location of the spot on the stellar surface can be fairly well constrained from the analysis of lensing light curves.

"  The phase diagram of two dimensional Josephson arrays is studied by means of the mapping to the quantum XY model. The quantum effects onto the thermodynamics of the system can be evaluated with quantitative accuracy by a semiclassical method, the {\em pure-quantum self-consistent harmonic approximation}, and those of dissipation can be included in the same framework by the Caldeira-Leggett model. Within this scheme, the critical temperature of the superconductor-to-insulator transition, which is a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless one, can be calculated in an extremely easy way as a function of the quantum coupling and of the dissipation mechanism. Previous quantum Monte Carlo results for the same model appear to be rather inaccurate, while the comparison with experimental data leads to conclude that the commonly assumed model is not suitable to describe in detail the real system.

"  We view sequential design as a model selection problem to determine which new observation is expected to be the most informative, given the existing set of observations. For estimating a probability distribution on a bounded interval, we use bounds constructed from kernel density estimators along with the estimated density itself to estimate the information gain expected from each observation. We choose Bernstein polynomials for the kernel functions because they provide a complete set of basis functions for polynomials of finite degree and thus have useful convergence properties. We illustrate the method with applications to estimating network reliability polynomials, which give the probability of certain sets of configurations in finite, discrete stochastic systems.

"  The SHGH conjecture proposes a solution to the question of how many conditions a general union of fat points imposes on the complete linear system of curves in $\mathbb P^2$ of fixed degree $d$, and it is known to be true in many cases. We propose a new problem, namely to understand the number of conditions imposed by a general union of fat points on the incomplete linear system defined by the condition of passing through a given finite set of points $Z$ (not general). Motivated by work of Di Gennaro-Ilardi-Vall\`es and Faenzi-Vall\`es, we give a careful analysis for the case where there is a single general fat point, which has multiplicity $d-1$. There is an expected number of conditions imposed by this fat point, and we study those $Z$ for which this expected value is not achieved. We show, for instance, that if $Z$ is in linear general position then such unexpected curves do not exist. We give criteria for the occurrence of such unexpected curves and describe the range of values of $d$ for which they occur. Unexpected curves have a very particular structure, which we describe, and they are often unique for a given set of points. In particular, we give a criterion for when they are irreducible, and we exhibit examples both where they are reducible and where they are irreducible. Furthermore, we relate properties of $Z$ to properties of the arrangement of lines dual to the points of $Z$. In particular, we obtain a new interpretation of the splitting type of a line arrangement. Finally, we use our results to establish a Lefschetz-like criterion for Terao's conjecture on the freeness of line arrangements.

Our aim is to point out the nice poset provided by the intersections of the irreducible components in the boundary, which provides a geometric realization of the nested set poset of this generalized Dowling lattice. It can be represented by a family of forests with leaves and labelings that depend on the triple (n,G,V). We will study it from the enumerative point of view in the case when G is abelian.

"  Most available antimicrobial peptides (AMP) prediction methods use common approach for different classes of AMP. Contrary to available approaches, we suggest, that a strategy of prediction should be based on the fact, that there are several kinds of AMP which are vary in mechanisms of action, structure, mode of interaction with membrane etc. According to our suggestion for each kind of AMP a particular approach has to be developed in order to get high efficacy. Consequently in this paper a particular but the biggest class of AMP - linear cationic antimicrobial peptides (LCAP) - has been considered and a newly developed simple method of LCAP prediction described. The aim of this study is the development of a simple method of discrimination of AMP from non-AMP, the efficiency of which will be determined by efficiencies of selected descriptors only and comparison the results of the discrimination procedure with the results obtained by more complicated discriminative methods. As descriptors the physicochemical characteristics responsible for capability of the peptide to interact with an anionic membrane were considered. The following characteristics such as hydrophobicity, amphiphaticity, location of the peptide in relation to membrane, charge, propensity to disordered structure were studied. On the basis of these characteristics a new simple algorithm of prediction is developed and evaluation of efficacies of the characteristics as descriptors performed. The results show that three descriptors: hydrophobic moment, charge and location of the peptide along the membranes can be used as discriminators of LCAPs. For the training set our method gives the same level of accuracy as more complicated machine learning approaches offered as CAMP database service tools. For the test set sensitivity obtained by our method gives even higher value than the one obtained by CAMP prediction tools.

A model where clusters freeze when they reach diameter at least N was studied in earlier papers. Using volume as a way to measure the size of a cluster - instead of diameter - leads, for large N, to a quite different behavior (contrary to what happens on the binary tree, where the volume model and the diameter model are ""asymptotically the same"").

"  The on-going X-ray all-sky survey with the eROSITA instrument will yield large galaxy cluster samples, which will bring strong constraints on cosmological parameters. In particular, the survey holds great promise to investigate the tension between CMB and low-redshift measurements. The current bottleneck preventing the full exploitation of the survey data is the systematics associated with the relation between survey observable and halo mass. Numerous recent studies have shown that gas mass and core-excised X-ray luminosity exhibit very low scatter at fixed mass. We propose a new method to reconstruct these quantities from low photon count data and validate the method using extensive eROSITA-like simulations. We find that even near the detection threshold of ~50 counts the core-excised luminosity and the gas mass can be recovered with 20-30% precision, which is substantially less than the scatter of the full integrated X-ray luminosity at fixed mass. When combined with an accurate calibration of the absolute mass scale (e.g. through weak gravitational lensing), our technique reduces the systematics on cosmological parameters induced by the mass calibration.

"  We investigate models of charged lepton and neutrino masses and lepton mixing based on broken modular symmetry. The matter fields in these models are assumed to transform in irreducible representations of the finite modular group $\Gamma_4 \simeq S_4$. We analyse the minimal scenario in which the only source of symmetry breaking is the vacuum expectation value of the modulus field. In this scenario there is no need to introduce flavon fields. Using the basis for the lowest weight modular forms found earlier, we build minimal phenomenologically viable models in which the neutrino masses are generated via the type I seesaw mechanism. While successfully accommodating charged lepton masses, neutrino mixing angles and mass-squared differences, these models predict the values of the lightest neutrino mass (i.e., the absolute neutrino mass scale), of the Dirac and Majorana CP violation (CPV) phases, as well as specific correlations between the values of the atmospheric neutrino mixing parameter $\sin^2\theta_{23}$ and i) the Dirac CPV phase $\delta$, ii) the sum of the neutrino masses, and iii) the effective Majorana mass in neutrinoless double beta decay.

"  We present a detailed analysis of QED corrections to $\bar{B} \to \bar{K} \ell^+ \ell^-$ decays at the double-differential level. Cancellations of soft and collinear divergences are demonstrated analytically using the phase space slicing method. Whereas soft divergences are found to cancel at the differential level, the cancellation of the hard-collinear logs $\ln m_\ell$ require, besides photon-inclusiveness, a specific choice of kinematic variables. In particular, hard-collinear logs in the lepton-pair invariant mass distribution ($q^2$), are sizeable and need to be treated with care when comparing with experiment. Virtual and real amplitudes are evaluated using an effective mesonic Lagrangian. Crucially, we show that going beyond this approximation does not introduce any further infrared sensitive terms.

"  Messenger RNA-based medicines hold immense potential, as evidenced by their rapid deployment as COVID-19 vaccines. However, worldwide distribution of mRNA molecules has been limited by their thermostability, which is fundamentally limited by the intrinsic instability of RNA molecules to a chemical degradation reaction called in-line hydrolysis. Predicting the degradation of an RNA molecule is a key task in designing more stable RNA-based therapeutics. Here, we describe a crowdsourced machine learning competition (""Stanford OpenVaccine"") on Kaggle, involving single-nucleotide resolution measurements on 6043 102-130-nucleotide diverse RNA constructs that were themselves solicited through crowdsourcing on the RNA design platform Eterna. The entire experiment was completed in less than 6 months. Winning models demonstrated test set errors that were better by 50% than the previous state-of-the-art DegScore model. Furthermore, these models generalized to blindly predicting orthogonal degradation data on much longer mRNA molecules (504-1588 nucleotides) with improved accuracy over DegScore and other models. Top teams integrated natural language processing architectures and data augmentation techniques with predictions from previous dynamic programming models for RNA secondary structure. These results indicate that such models are capable of representing in-line hydrolysis with excellent accuracy, supporting their use for designing stabilized messenger RNAs. The integration of two crowdsourcing platforms, one for data set creation and another for machine learning, may be fruitful for other urgent problems that demand scientific discovery on rapid timescales.

"  A single dish monitoring of millimeter maser lines SiS J=14-13 and HCN nu_2 = 1^f J=3-2 and several other rotational lines is reported for the archetypal carbon star IRC+10216. Relative line strength variations of 5%~30% are found for eight molecular line features with respect to selected reference lines. Definite line-shape variation is found in limited velocity intervals of the SiS and HCN line profiles. The asymmetrical line profiles of the two lines are mainly due to the varying components. Their dominant varying components of the line profiles have similar periods and phases as the IR light variation, although both quantities show some degree of velocity dependence; there is also variability asymmetry between the blue and red line wings of both lines. Combining the velocities and amplitudes with a wind velocity model, we suggest that the line profile variations are due to SiS and HCN masing lines emanating from the wind acceleration zone. The possible link of the variabilities to thermal, dynamical and/or chemical processes within or under this region is also discussed. ",Monitor variability of millimeter lines in IRC +10216

Second, we prove that for a certain class of initial wave profiles the corresponding solutions do indeed blow-up in finite time. ",Wave breaking of periodic solutions to the Fornberg-Whitham equation
"  There has been recent interest in the conditional central limit question for (strictly) stationary, ergodic processes $...,X_{-1},X_0,X_1,...$ whose partial sums $S_n=X_1+...+X_n$ are of the form $S_n=M_n+R_n$, where $M_n$ is a square integrable martingale with stationary increments and $R_n$ is a remainder term for which $E(R_n^2)=o(n)$. Here we explore the law of the iterated logarithm (LIL) for the same class of processes. Letting $\Vert\cdot\Vert$ denote the norm in $L^2(P)$, a sufficient condition for the partial sums of a stationary process to have the form $S_n=M_n+R_n$ is that $n^{-3/2}\Vert E(S_n|X_0,X_{-1},...)\Vert$ be summable. A sufficient condition for the LIL is only slightly stronger, requiring $n^{-3/2}\log^{3/2}(n)\Vert E(S_n|X_0,X_{-1},...)\Vert$ to be summable. As a by-product of our main result, we obtain an improved statement of the conditional central limit theorem. Invariance principles are obtained as well.

"  Denoising filters, such as bilateral, guided, and total variation filters, applied to images on general graphs may require repeated application if noise is not small enough. We formulate two acceleration techniques of the resulted iterations: conjugate gradient method and Nesterov's acceleration. We numerically show efficiency of the accelerated nonlinear filters for image denoising and demonstrate 2-12 times speed-up, i.e., the acceleration techniques reduce the number of iterations required to reach a given peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) by the above indicated factor of 2-12.

"  Multiple testing with false discovery rate (FDR) control has been widely conducted in the ``discrete paradigm"" where p-values have discrete and heterogeneous null distributions. However, in this scenario existing FDR procedures often lose some power and may yield unreliable inference, and for this scenario there does not seem to be an FDR procedure that partitions hypotheses into groups, employs data-adaptive weights and is non-asymptotically conservative. We propose a weighted FDR procedure for multiple testing in the discrete paradigm that efficiently adapts to both the heterogeneity and discreteness of p-value distributions. We theoretically justify the non-asymptotic conservativeness of the weighted FDR procedure under independence, and show via simulation studies that, for multiple testing based on p-values of Binomial test or Fisher's exact test, it is more powerful than six other procedures. The weighted FDR procedure is applied to a drug safety study and a differential methylation study based on discrete data, where it makes more discoveries than two existing methods.

"  Ocean swell plays an important role in the transport of energy across the ocean, yet its evolution is still not well understood. In the late 1960s, the nonlinear Schr{\""o}dinger (NLS) equation was derived as a model for the propagation of ocean swell over large distances. More recently, a number of dissipative generalizations of the NLS equation based on a simple dissipation assumption have been proposed. These models have been shown to accurately model wave evolution in the laboratory setting, but their validity in modeling ocean swell has not previously been examined. We study the efficacy of the NLS equation and four of its generalizations in modeling the evolution of swell in the ocean. The dissipative generalizations perform significantly better than conservative models and are overall reasonable models for swell amplitudes, indicating dissipation is an important physical effect in ocean swell evolution. The nonlinear models did not out-perform their linearizations, indicating linear models may be sufficient in modeling ocean swell evolution.

"  Cooperation and defection may be considered as two extreme responses to a social dilemma. Yet the reality is much less clear-cut. Between the two extremes lies an interval of ambivalent choices, which may be captured theoretically by means of continuous strategies defining the extent of the contributions of each individual player to the common pool. If strategies are chosen from the unit interval, where 0 corresponds to pure defection and 1 corresponds to the maximal contribution, the question is what is the characteristic level of individual investments to the common pool that emerges if the evolution is guided by different benefit functions. Here we consider the steepness and the threshold as two parameters defining an array of generalized benefit functions, and we show that in a structured population there exist intermediate values of both at which the collective contributions are maximal. However, as the cost-to-benefit ratio of cooperation increases the characteristic threshold decreases, while the corresponding steepness increases. Our observations remain valid if more complex sigmoid functions are used, thus reenforcing the importance of carefully adjusted benefits for high levels of public cooperation.

"  Satellite formation is a natural by-product of planet formation. With the discovery of nu- merous extrasolar planets, it is likely that moons of extrasolar planets (exomoons) will soon be discovered. Some of the most promising techniques can yield both the mass and radius of the moon. Here, I review recent ideas about the formation of moons in our Solar System, and discuss the prospects of extrapolating these theories to predict the sizes of moons that may be discovered around extrasolar planets. It seems likely that planet-planet collisions could create satellites around rocky or icy planets which are large enough to be detected by currently available techniques. Detectable exomoons around gas giants may be able to form by co-accretion or capture, but determining the upper limit on likely moon masses at gas giant planets requires more detailed, modern simulations of these processes.

"  We present an expression for the QCD amplitude for a general hard scattering process with any number of soft gluon emissions, to one-loop accuracy. The amplitude is written in two different but equivalent ways: as a product of operators ordered in dipole transverse momentum and as a product of loop-expanded currents. We hope that these results will help in the development of an all-orders algorithm for multiple emissions that includes the full colour structure and both the real and imaginary contributions to the amplitude.

"  Disparate areas of machine learning have benefited from models that can take raw data with little preprocessing as input and learn rich representations of that raw data in order to perform well on a given prediction task. We evaluate this approach in healthcare by using longitudinal measurements of lab tests, one of the more raw signals of a patient's health state widely available in clinical data, to predict disease onsets. In particular, we train a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network and two novel convolutional neural networks for multi-task prediction of disease onset for 133 conditions based on 18 common lab tests measured over time in a cohort of 298K patients derived from 8 years of administrative claims data. We compare the neural networks to a logistic regression with several hand-engineered, clinically relevant features. We find that the representation-based learning approaches significantly outperform this baseline. We believe that our work suggests a new avenue for patient risk stratification based solely on lab results. ",Multi-task Prediction of Disease Onsets from Longitudinal Lab Tests
"  The results of an investigation of fundamental banjo acoustics and physics are now readily available. The papers describe measurements and calculations which demonstrate the extent to which the sound of a banjo can be represented by linear modeling of the basic parts common to the banjo family: strings, drum head, light floating bridge, and break angle. This note summarizes the conclusions of that work and outlines some of the physics involved. While the scrutinized banjo behaviors are well-known to discerning builders and pickers, the focus here is how these arise from the physics. A practical application (discussed in an addendum) concerns head tap-tuning: what's going on, how it works, and why some people and some tuners can't get it right.

"  This study explores the use of origami composite structures as active aerodynamic control surfaces. Towards this goal, two origami concepts were designed leveraging a combination of analytical and finite element modeling, and computational fluid dynamics simulations. Wind tunnel tests were performed at different dynamic pressures in conjunction with two different active control laws to test the capability of obtaining desired drag values. The experiments revealed excellent structural rigidity and folding characteristics under aerodynamic loading. Future work will focus on developing advanced origami designs that allow for more deterministic folding as well as improved weight, stiffness, and fatigue characteristics in the use of materials. Upon completion of these improvements, it is anticipated that full-scale testing on a vehicle could be meaningfully conducted. ",Aerogami: Composite Origami Structures as Active Aerodynamic Control
"  As the digital news industry becomes the main channel of information dissemination, the adverse impact of fake news is explosively magnified. The credibility of a news report should not be considered in isolation. Rather, previously published news articles on the similar event could be used to assess the credibility of a news report. Inspired by this, we propose a BERT-based multimodal unreliable news detection framework, which captures both textual and visual information from unreliable articles utilising the contrastive learning strategy. The contrastive learner interacts with the unreliable news classifier to push similar credible news (or similar unreliable news) closer while moving news articles with similar content but opposite credibility labels away from each other in the multimodal embedding space. Experimental results on a COVID-19 related dataset, ReCOVery, show that our model outperforms a number of competitive baseline in unreliable news detection.

We give a characterisation of ${\sf TC}_r(K(\pi, 1))$ in terms of classifying spaces for equivariant Bredon cohomology. Our recent paper \cite{FGLO}, joint with M. Grant and G. Lupton, treats the special case $r=2$. We also obtain in this paper useful lower bounds for ${\sf TC}_r(\pi)$ in terms of cohomological dimension of subgroups of $\pi\times\pi\times \dots\times \pi$ ($r$ times) with certain properties. As an illustration of the main technique we find the higher topological complexity of the Higman's groups. We also apply our method to obtain a lower bound for the higher topological complexity of the right angled Artin (RAA) groups, which, as was established in \cite{GGY} by a different method (in a more general situation), coincides with the precise value. We finish the paper by a discussion of the ${\sf TC}$-generating function $\sum_{r=1}^\infty {\sf TC}_{r+1}(X)x^r$ encoding the values of the higher topological complexity ${\sf TC}_r(X)$ for all values of $r$. We show that in many examples (including the case when $X=K(H, 1)$ with $H$ being a RAA group) the ${\sf TC}$-generating function is a rational function of the form $\frac{P(x)}{(1-x)^2}$ where $P(x)$ is an integer polynomial with $P(1)={\sf cat}(X)$.

"  We consider a generalisation of Ulam's method for approximating invariant densities of one-dimensional chaotic maps. Rather than use piecewise constant polynomials to approximate the density, we use polynomials of degree n which are defined by the requirement that they preserve the measure on n+1 neighbouring subintervals. Over the whole interval, this results in a discontinuous piecewise polynomial approximation to the density. We prove error results where this approach is used to approximate smooth densities. We also consider the computation of the Lyapunov exponent using the polynomial density and show that the order of convergence is one order better than for the density itself. Together with using cubic polynomials in the density approximation, this yields a very efficient method for computing highly accurate estimates of the Lyapunov exponent. We illustrate the theoretical findings with some examples. ",Computing the Invariant Measure and the Lyapunov Exponent for   One-Dimensional Maps using a Measure-Preserving Polynomial Basis
"  We consider the incompressible Euler or Navier-Stokes (NS) equations on a torus T^d in the functional setting of the Sobolev spaces H^n(T^d) of divergence free, zero mean vector fields on T^d, for n > d/2+1. We present a general theory of approximate solutions for the Euler/NS Cauchy problem; this allows to infer a lower bound T_c on the time of existence of the exact solution u analyzing a posteriori any approximate solution u_a, and also to construct a function R_n such that || u(t) - u_a(t) ||_n <= R_n(t) for all t in [0,T_c). Both T_c and R_n are determined solving suitable ""control inequalities"", depending on the error of u_a; the fully quantitative implementation of this scheme depends on some previous estimates of ours on the Euler/NS quadratic nonlinearity [15][16]. To keep in touch with the existing literature on the subject, our results are compared with a setting for approximate Euler/NS solutions proposed in [3]. As a first application of the present framework, we consider the Galerkin approximate solutions of the Euler/NS Cauchy problem, with a specific initial datum considered in [2]: in this case our methods allow, amongst else, to prove global existence for the NS Cauchy problem when the viscosity is above an explicitly given bound.

"  The HBT radii extracted in p-pbar and pp collisions at SPS and Tevatron show a clear correlation with the charged particle rapidity density. We propose to explain the correlation using a simple model where the distance from the initial hard parton-parton scattering to the hadronization point depends on the energy of the partons emitted. Since the particle multiplicity is correlated with the mean energy of the partons produced we can explain the experimental observations without invoking scenarios that assume a thermal fireball. The model has been applied with success to the existing experimental data both in the magnitude and the intensity of the correlation. As well, the model has been extended to pp collisions at the LHC energy of 14 TeV. The possibilities of a better insight into the string spatial development using 3D HBT analysis is discussed.

"  We study the strong coupling problem in the Horava-Melby-Thompson setup of the Horava-Lifshitz gravity with an arbitrary coupling constant $\lambda$, generalized recently by da Silva, where $\lambda$ describes the deviation of the theory in the infrared from general relativity that has $\lambda_{GR} = 1$. We find that a scalar field in the Minkowski background becomes strong coupling for processes with energy higher than $\Lambda_{\omega} [\equiv (M_{pl}/c_1)^{3/2} M_{pl}|\lambda - 1|^{5/4}]$, where generically $c_1 \ll M_{pl}$. However, this problem can be cured by introducing a new energy scale $M_{*}$, so that $M_{*} < \Lambda_{\omega}$, where $M_{*}$ denotes the suppression energy of high order derivative terms of the theory.

Such a coloring is $d$-polychromatic if every $Q_d$ in the $Q_n$ contains a $Q_\ell$ of every color. In this paper we consider a specific class of $Q_\ell$-colorings that are called linear. Given $\ell$ and $d$, let $p_{lin}^\ell(d)$ be the largest number of colors such that there is a $d$-polychromatic linear $Q_\ell$-coloring of $Q_n$ for all $n \ge d$. We prove that for all $d \ge 3$, $p_{lin}^{d-1}(d) = 2$.

"  Using a fermiology approach to the computation of the magnetic susceptibility measured by neutron scattering in hole-doped high-Tc superconductors, we estimate the effects on the incommensurate peaks caused by higher d-wave harmonics of the superconducting order parameter induced by underdoping. The input parameters for the Fermi surface and d-wave gap are taken directly from angle resolved photoemission (ARPES) experiments on Bi{2}Sr{2}CaCu{2}O{8+x} (Bi2212). We find that higher d-wave harmonics lower the momentum dependent spin gap at the incommensurate peaks as measured by the lowest spectral edge of the imaginary part in the frequency dependence of the magnetic susceptibility of Bi2212. This effect is robust whenever the fermiology approach captures the physics of high-Tc superconductors. At energies above the resonance we observe diagonal incommensurate peaks. We show that the crossover from parallel incommensuration below the resonance energy to diagonal incommensuration above it is connected to the values and the degeneracies of the minima of the 2-particle energy continuum.

We provide examples of our method in the case of simply connected quadrature domains. ",How to count zeroes of polynomials on quadrature domains using the   Bezout matrix
"  Distributed machine learning has been widely studied in order to handle exploding amount of data. In this paper, we study an important yet less visited distributed learning problem where features are inherently distributed or vertically partitioned among multiple parties, and sharing of raw data or model parameters among parties is prohibited due to privacy concerns. We propose an ADMM sharing framework to approach risk minimization over distributed features, where each party only needs to share a single value for each sample in the training process, thus minimizing the data leakage risk. We establish convergence and iteration complexity results for the proposed parallel ADMM algorithm under non-convex loss. We further introduce a novel differentially private ADMM sharing algorithm and bound the privacy guarantee with carefully designed noise perturbation. The experiments based on a prototype system shows that the proposed ADMM algorithms converge efficiently in a robust fashion, demonstrating advantage over gradient based methods especially for data set with high dimensional feature spaces.

"  Entanglement generation at a macroscopic scale offers an exciting avenue to develop new quantum technologies and study fundamental physics on a tabletop. Cavity quantum optomechanics provides an ideal platform to generate and exploit such phenomena owing to the precision of quantum optics combined with recent experimental advances in optomechanical devices. In this work, we propose schemes operating outside the resolved-sideband regime, to prepare and verify both optical-mechanical and mechanical-mechanical entanglement. Our schemes employ pulsed interactions with a duration much less than the mechanical period and, together with homodyne measurements, can both generate and characterize these types of entanglement. To improve the performance of our schemes, a precooling stage comprising prior pulses can be utilized to increase the amount of entanglement prepared, and local optical squeezers may be used to provide resilience against open-system dynamics. The entanglement generated by our schemes is quantified using the logarithmic negativity and is analysed with respect to the strength of the pulsed optomechanical interactions for realistic experimental scenarios including mechanical decoherence and optical loss. Two separate schemes for mechanical entanglement generation are introduced and compared: one scheme based on an optical interferometric design, and the other comprising sequential optomechanical interactions. The pulsed nature of our protocols provides more direct access to these quantum correlations in the time domain, with applications including quantum metrology and tests of quantum decoherence. By considering a parameter set based on recent experiments, the feasibility to generate significant entanglement with our schemes, even with large optical losses, is demonstrated.

"  Cloud computing offers a variable-cost payment scheme that allows cloud customers to specify the price they are willing to pay for renting spot instances to run their applications at much lower costs than fixed payment schemes, and depending on the varying demand from cloud customers, cloud platforms could revoke spot instances at any time. To alleviate the effect of spot instance revocations, applications often employ different fault-tolerance mechanisms to minimize or even eliminate the lost work for each spot instance revocation. However, these fault-tolerance mechanisms incur additional overhead related to application completion time and deployment cost. We propose a novel cloud market-based approach that leverages cloud spot market features to provision spot instances without employing fault-tolerance mechanisms to reduce the deployment cost and completion time of applications. We evaluate our approach in simulations and use Amazon spot instances that contain jobs in Docker containers and realistic price traces from EC2 markets. Our simulation results show that our approach reduces the deployment cost and completion time compared to approaches based on fault-tolerance mechanisms.

"  There are various notions of positivity for matrices and linear matrix-valued maps that play important roles in quantum information theory. The cones of positive semidefinite matrices and completely positive linear maps, which represent quantum states and quantum channels respectively, are the most ubiquitous positive cones. There are also many natural cones that can been regarded as ""more"" or ""less"" positive than these standard examples. In particular, entanglement theory deals with the cones of separable operators and entanglement witnesses, which satisfy very strong and weak positivity properties respectively.   Rather complementary to the various cones that arise in entanglement theory are norms. The trace and operator norms for operators and the diamond and completely bounded norms for superoperators are the typical norms that are seen throughout quantum information theory. In this work our main goal is to develop a family of norms that play a role analogous to the cone of entanglement witnesses. We investigate the basic mathematical properties of these norms, including their relationships with other well-known norms, their isometry groups, and their dual norms. We also make the place of these norms in entanglement theory rigorous by showing that entanglement witnesses arise from minimal operator systems, and analogously our norms arise from minimal operator spaces.   Finally, we connect the various cones and norms considered here to several seemingly unrelated problems from other areas. We characterize the problem of whether or not non-positive partial transpose bound entangled states exist in terms of one of our norms, and provide evidence in favour of their existence. We also characterize the minimum gate fidelity of a quantum channel, the maximum output purity and its completely bounded counterpart, and the geometric measure of entanglement in terms of these norms.

"  An analog of the Falconer distance problem in vector spaces over finite fields asks for the threshold $\alpha>0$ such that $|\Delta(E)| \gtrsim q$ whenever $|E| \gtrsim q^{\alpha}$, where $E \subset {\Bbb F}_q^d$, the $d$-dimensional vector space over a finite field with $q$ elements (not necessarily prime). Here $\Delta(E)=\{{(x_1-y_1)}^2+...+{(x_d-y_d)}^2: x,y \in E\}$. In two dimensions we improve the known exponent to $\tfrac{4}{3}$, consistent with the corresponding exponent in Euclidean space obtained by Wolff.   The pinned distance set $\Delta_y(E)=\{{(x_1-y_1)}^2+...+{(x_d-y_d)}^2: x\in E\}$ for a pin $y\in E$ has been studied in the Euclidean setting. Peres and Schlag showed that if the Hausdorff dimension of a set $E$ is greater than $\tfrac{d+1}{2}$ then the Lebesgue measure of $\Delta_y(E)$ is positive for almost every pin $y$. In this paper we obtain the analogous result in the finite field setting. In addition, the same result is shown to be true for the pinned dot product set $\Pi_y(E)=\{x\cdot y: x\in E\}$. Under the additional assumption that the set $E$ has cartesian product structure we improve the pinned threshold for both distances and dot products to $\frac{d^2}{2d-1}$.   A generalization of the Falconer distance problem is determine the minimal $\alpha>0$ such that $E$ contains a congruent copy of every $k$ dimensional simplex whenever $|E| \gtrsim q^{\alpha}$.

"  For an $A_p$ weight $w$ the norm of the Hilbert Transform in $L^p(w)$, $1<p<\infty$ is estimated by $[w]_{A_p}^{s}$, where $[w]_{A_p}$ is the $A_p$ characteristic of the weight $w$ and $s = \max(1,1/(p-1))$; as simple examples with power weights show, these estimates are sharp.   A natural question to ask, is whether it is possible to improve the exponent $s$ in the above estimate if one replaces the $A_p$ characteristic by its ""fattened"" version, where the averages are replaced by Poisson-like averages. For power weights (for example with $p=2$ and Poisson averages) one can see that there is indeed an improvement in the exponent: but is it true for general weights?   In this paper we show that the optimal exponent $s$ remains the same by constructing counterexamples for arbitrarily ""smooth"" weights (in the sense that the doubling constant is arbitrarily close to $2$), so the ""fattened"" $A_p$ characteristic is equivalent to the classical one, and such that $\|T\|_{L^p(w)} \sim [w]_{A_p}^{s}$.   We use the ideas from the unpublished manuscript by F. Nazarov disproving Sarason's conjecture. We start from simple classical counterexamples for dyadic models, and then by using what we call ""small step construction"" we transform them into examples with weights that are arbitrarily dyadically smooth. F.~Nazarov had used Bellman function method to prove the existence of such examples, but our construction gives a way to get such examples from the standard dyadic ones. We then use a modification of ""remodeling"", introduced by J.~Bourgain and developed by F.~Nazarov, to get from examples for dyadic models to examples for the Hilbert transform.   As an added bonus, we present a proof that the $L^p$ analog of Sarason's conjecture is false for all $p$, $1<p<\infty$.

In particular, we characterize the secrecy capacity with a rate-limited local source of randomness and a less capable eavesdropper's channel, which shows that limited rate incurs a secrecy rate penalty but does not preclude secrecy. We also discuss a more practical aspect of rate-limited randomization in the context of cooperative jamming.

"  Developing an efficient non-linear Horn clause solver is a challenging task since the solver has to reason about the tree structures rather than the linear ones as in a linear solver. In this paper we propose an incremental approach to solving a set of non-linear Horn clauses using a linear Horn clause solver. We achieve this by interleaving a program transformation and a linear solver. The program transformation is based on the notion of tree dimension, which we apply to trees corresponding to Horn clause derivations. The dimension of a tree is a measure of its non-linearity -- for example a linear tree (whose nodes have at most one child) has dimension zero while a complete binary tree has dimension equal to its height.   A given set of Horn clauses $P$ can be transformed into a new set of clauses $P^k$ (whose derivation trees are the subset of $P$'s derivation trees with dimension at most $k$). We start by generating $P^k$ with $k=0$, which is linear by definition, then pass it to a linear solver. If $P^k$ has a solution $M$, and is a solution to $P$ then $P$ has a solution $M$. If $M$ is not a solution of $P$, we plugged $M$ to $P^{(k+1)}$ which again becomes linear and pass it to the solver and continue successively for increasing value of $k$ until we find a solution to $P$ or resources are exhausted. Experiment on some Horn clause verification benchmarks indicates that this is a promising approach for solving a set of non-linear Horn clauses using a linear solver. It indicates that many times a solution obtained for some under-approximation $P^k$ of $P$ becomes a solution for $P$ for a fairly small value of $k$.

In particular, a gapped topological Fulde-Ferrell superfluid, in which the chiral edge states at opposite boundaries possess the same chirality, is predicted.

"  We consider the scenario in which a set of sources generate messages in a network and a receiver node demands an arbitrary linear function of these messages. We formulate an algebraic test to determine whether an arbitrary network can compute linear functions using linear codes. We identify a class of linear functions that can be computed using linear codes in every network that satisfies a natural cut-based condition. Conversely, for another class of linear functions, we show that the cut-based condition does not guarantee the existence of a linear coding solution. For linear functions over the binary field, the two classes are complements of each other. ",Computing linear functions by linear coding over networks
"  Adaptive behavior, cognition and emotion are the result of a bewildering variety of brain spatiotemporal activity patterns. An important problem in neuroscience is to understand the mechanism by which the human brain's 100 billion neurons and 100 trillion synapses manage to produce this large repertoire of cortical configurations in a flexible manner. In addition, it is recognized that temporal correlations across such configurations cannot be arbitrary, but they need to meet two conflicting demands: while diverse cortical areas should remain functionally segregated from each other, they must still perform as a collective, i.e., they are functionally integrated. Here, we investigate these large-scale dynamical properties by inspecting the character of the spatiotemporal correlations of brain resting-state activity. In physical systems, these correlations in space and time are captured by measuring the correlation coefficient between a signal recorded at two different points in space at two different times. We show that this two-point correlation function extracted from resting-state fMRI data exhibits self-similarity in space and time. In space, self-similarity is revealed by considering three successive spatial coarse-graining steps while in time it is revealed by the 1/f frequency behavior of the power spectrum. The uncovered dynamical self-similarity implies that the brain is spontaneously at a continuously changing (in space and time) intermediate state between two extremes, one of excessive cortical integration and the other of complete segregation. This dynamical property may be seen as an important marker of brain well-being both in health and disease. ",Self-similar correlation function in brain resting-state fMRI
"  In data modelling, product information has most often been handled separately from process information. The integration of product and process models in a unified data model could provide the means by which information could be shared across an enterprise throughout the system lifecycle from design through to production. Recently attempts have been made to integrate these two separate views of systems through identifying common data models. This paper relates description-driven systems to multi-layer architectures and reveals where existing design patterns facilitate the integration of product and process models and where patterns are missing or where existing patterns require enrichment for this integration. It reports on the construction of a so-called description-driven system which integrates Product Data Management (PDM) and Workflow Management (WfM) data models through a common meta-model.

"  Here we report our recent results of variability studies in optical and X-ray bands of three blazars namely 3C 273, PKS 2155 - 304 and BL Lacertae with XMM-Newton. We found large amplitude optical to X-rays variability in 3C 273, and PKS 2155 - 304 on year time scale. In 3C 273, we noticed that synchrotron cooling and particle acceleration are at work at different epoch of observations. In PKS 2155 - 304, spectral energy distribution from optical to X-ray is fitted with LPPL (log parabolic + power law) model. In BL Lacertae, optical flux and degree of polarization were anti-correlated. ",Optical and X-ray Variability of Blazars
"  This paper addresses the issue of policy evaluation in Markov Decision Processes, using linear function approximation. It provides a unified view of algorithms such as TD(lambda), LSTD(lambda), iLSTD, residual-gradient TD. It is asserted that they all consist in minimizing a gradient function and differ by the form of this function and their means of minimizing it. Two new schemes are introduced in that framework: Full-gradient TD which uses a generalization of the principle introduced in iLSTD, and EGD TD, which reduces the gradient by successive equi-gradient descents. These three algorithms form a new intermediate family with the interesting property of making much better use of the samples than TD while keeping a gradient descent scheme, which is useful for complexity issues and optimistic policy iteration.

"  We present a reentrant phase transition in a bridging model between two different topological models: Kitaev and Haldane chains. This model is activated by introducing a bond alternation into the Kitaev chain [A. Yu Kitaev, Phys.-Usp. {\bf 44} 131 (2001)]. Without the bond alternation, finite pairing potential induces a topological state defined by zero-energy Majorana edge mode, while finite bond alternation without the pairing potential makes a different topological state similar to the Haldane state, which is defined by local Berry phase in the bulk. The topologically-ordered state corresponds to the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger state, which is classified as the same symmetry class. We thus find a phase transition between the two topological phases with a reentrant phenomenon, and extend the phase diagram in the plane of the pairing potential and the bond alternation by using three techniques: recursive equation, fidelity, and Pfaffian. In addition, we find that the phase transition is characterized by both the change of the position of Majorana zero-energy modes from one edge to the other edge and the emergence of a string order in the bulk, and that the reentrance is based on a sublattice U(1) rotation. Consequently, our study and model do not only open a direct way to discuss the bulk and edge topologies, but demonstrate an example of the reentrant topologies.

"  In the current paper, we analyzed the variation of cosmic radiation flux with elevation, time of the year and ambient temperature with the help of a portable cosmic muon detector, the construction of which was completed by a team from Southern Arkansas University (SAU) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL). Cosmic muons and gamma rays traverse two synchronized scintillators connected to two photomultiplier tubes (PMT) via light guides, and generate electronic pulses which we counted using a Data Acquisition Board (DAQ). Because muons are the product of collisions between high-energy cosmic rays and atmospheric nuclei, and therefore shower onto earth, the scintillators were arranged horizontally for detection. The elevation measurements were recorded at different locations, starting from 60 feet below sea-level at the Underground Radiation Counting Laboratory at Johnson Space Center, TX, to 4200 feet at Mt. Hamilton, CA. Intermediate locations included sea-level Galveston Bay, TX, and Mt. Magazine, AR (2800 feet). The data points showed a noticeable increase in flux as elevation increases, independent of latitude. Measurements investigating the dependence of cosmic rays on temperature and time of the year took place locally in Magnolia, AR. We found that cosmic muon flux is uniform, appears to be independent of conditions on earth, and is anti-correlative with temperature. We are convinced that the sun has minimal to zero effect on cosmic-ray flux; it cannot be a major contributing source of this background radiation. The source of cosmic radiation remains one of the biggest unanswered questions in physics today. ",Flux Variation of Cosmic Muons
"  We use the cluster variation method (CVM) to investigate the phase structure of the 3d gonihedric Ising actions defined by Savvidy and Wegner. The geometrical spin cluster boundaries in these systems serve as models for the string worldsheets of the gonihedric string embedded in ${\bf Z}^3$. The models are interesting from the statistical mechanical point of view because they have a vanishing bare surface tension. As a result the action depends only on the angles of the discrete surface and not on the area, which is the antithesis of the standard 3d Ising model.   The results obtained with the CVM are in good agreement with Monte Carlo simulations for the critical temperatures and the order of the transition as the self-avoidance coupling $\kappa$ is varied. The value of the magnetization critical exponent $\beta = 0.062 \pm 0.003$, calculated with the cluster variation--Pad\`e approximant method, is also close to the simulation results.

"  The spin glass behavior of Y2Mo2O7 has puzzled physicists for nearly three decades. Free of bulk disorder within the resolution of powder diffraction methods, it is thought that this material is a rare realization of a spin glass resulting from weak disorder such as bond disorder or local lattice distortions. Here, we report on the single crystal growth of Y2Mo2O7. Using neutron scattering, we present unique isotropic magnetic diffuse scattering arising beneath the spin glass transition despite having a well-ordered structure at the bulk level. Despite our attempts to model the diffuse scattering using a computationally exhaustive search of a class of simple spin Hamiltonians, we were unable to replicate the experimentally observed energy-integrated (diffuse) neutron scattering. A T^2-temperature dependence in the heat capacity and density functional theory calculations hint at significant frozen degeneracy in both the spin and orbital degrees of freedom resulting from spin-orbital coupling (Kugel-Khomskii type) and random fluctuations in the Mo environment at the local level.

"  We present results from a BeppoSAX (July 2001) observation of the FRI radio galaxy NGC6251, together with a re-analysis of archival ASCA (October 1994) and Chandra (September 2000) data. The weak detection above 10 keV and the lack of iron fluorescent K-alpha emission lines in the BeppoSAX spectrum rule out that the bulk of the X-ray emission is due to an obscured Seyfert nucleus. The study of the multiwavelength spectral energy distribution suggests instead that X-rays probably originate as inverse-Compton of synchrotron seed photons in a relativistic jet, indicating that NGC6251 hosts a low radio luminosity [L(5 GHz) ~10^40 erg/s] blazar. The BeppoSAX spectrum is flatter than in the earlier ASCA observation. This might be due to the emergence of a different spectral component during phases of lower X-ray flux. In this context, we discuss some possible explanations for the intense and mildly-ionized fluorescent iron line measured by ASCA.

"  Polar codes are a recent family of error-correcting codes with a number of desirable characteristics. Their disruptive nature is illustrated by their rapid adoption in the $5^{th}$-generation mobile-communication standard, where they are used to protect control messages. In this work, we describe a two-stage system tasked with identifying the location of control messages that consists of a detection and selection stage followed by a decoding one. The first stage spurs the need for polar-code detection algorithms with variable effort to balance complexity between the two stages. We illustrate this idea of variable effort for multiple detection algorithms aimed at the first stage. We propose three novel blind detection methods based on belief-propagation decoding inspired by early-stopping criteria. Then we show how their reliability improves with the number of decoding iterations to highlight the possible tradeoffs between accuracy and complexity. Additionally, we show similar tradeoffs for a detection method from previous work. In a setup where only one block encoded with the polar code of interest is present among many other blocks, our results notably show that, depending on the complexity budget, a variable number of undesirable blocks can be dismissed while achieving a missed-detection rate in line with the block-error rate of a complex decoding algorithm.

"  We report on the approach towards the hydrodynamic regime of boost-invariant N=4 super Yang-Mills plasma at strong coupling starting from various far-from-equilibrium states at tau=0. The results are obtained through numerical solution of Einstein's equations for the dual geometries, as described in detail in the companion article arXiv:1203.0755. Despite the very rich far-from-equilibrium evolution, we find surprising regularities in the form of clear correlations between initial entropy and total produced entropy, as well as between initial entropy and the temperature at thermalization, understood as the transition to a hydrodynamic description. For 29 different initial conditions that we consider, hydrodynamics turns out to be definitely applicable for proper times larger than 0.7 in units of inverse temperature at thermalization. We observe a sizable anisotropy in the energy-momentum tensor at thermalization, which is nevertheless entirely due to hydrodynamic effects. This suggests that effective thermalization in heavy ion collisions may occur significantly earlier than true thermalization.

"  For the first time we observed formation of small satellite droplets from the bridge at droplet coalescence. Investigations were made using a Hele-Shaw cell in the two-phase region at nematic-isotropic phase transition. In previous works on coalescence it was considered that before start of coalescence there exists a bridge between the outer fluid connecting regions on the two sides of the droplets (outer bridge). After start of coalescence a bridge connecting the two droplets appears (droplet bridge) and the outer bridge is broken. For the first time we have shown that there are coalescence processes when after start of coalescence both the droplet bridge and the outer bridge can exist. This cardinally changes the coalescence process. During the first coalescence stage the size of the outer bridge decreases, the size of the droplet bridge increases. During the second stage the outer bridge becomes unstable with pinch-off, formation of pointed end domains, secondary instability, splitting of pointed end domains and formation of satellite droplets. Our work connects two areas of fluid dynamics: coalescence and breakup with formation of satellite droplets.

"  Meta-Learning promises to enable more data-efficient inference by harnessing previous experience from related learning tasks. While existing meta-learning methods help us to improve the accuracy of our predictions in face of data scarcity, they fail to supply reliable uncertainty estimates, often being grossly overconfident in their predictions. Addressing these shortcomings, we introduce a novel meta-learning framework, called F-PACOH, that treats meta-learned priors as stochastic processes and performs meta-level regularization directly in the function space. This allows us to directly steer the probabilistic predictions of the meta-learner towards high epistemic uncertainty in regions of insufficient meta-training data and, thus, obtain well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. Finally, we showcase how our approach can be integrated with sequential decision making, where reliable uncertainty quantification is imperative. In our benchmark study on meta-learning for Bayesian Optimization (BO), F-PACOH significantly outperforms all other meta-learners and standard baselines. Even in a challenging lifelong BO setting, where optimization tasks arrive one at a time and the meta-learner needs to build up informative prior knowledge incrementally, our proposed method demonstrates strong positive transfer.

"  These are introductory lectures to some aspects of the physics of strongly correlated electron systems. I first explain the main reasons for strong correlations in several classes of materials. The basic principles of dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) are then briefly reviewed. I emphasize the formal analogies with classical mean-field theory and density functional theory, through the construction of free-energy functionals of a local observable. I review the application of DMFT to the Mott transition, and compare to recent spectroscopy and transport experiments. The key role of the quasiparticle coherence scale, and of transfers of spectral weight between low- and intermediate or high energies is emphasized. Above this scale, correlated metals enter an incoherent regime with unusual transport properties. The recent combinations of DMFT with electronic structure methods are also discussed, and illustrated by some applications to transition metal oxides and f-electron materials.

"  This paper discusses the possibility of making an object that precisely meets global structural requirements using additive manufacturing and feedback control. An experimental validation is presented by printing a cantilever beam with a prescribed stiffness requirement. The printing process is formalized as a model-based finite-horizon discrete control problem, where the control variables are the widths of the successive layers. Sensing is performed by making {\em in situ} intermediate stiffness measurements on the partially built part. The hypothesis that feedback control is effective in enabling the 3D-printed beam to meet precise stiffness requirements is validated experimentally.

"  This paper presents a search for the pair production of top squarks in events with a single isolated electron or muon, jets, large missing transverse momentum, and large transverse mass. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 19.5 inverse femtobarns of pp collisions collected in 2012 by the CMS experiment at the LHC at a center-of-mass energy of sqrt(s) = 8 TeV. No significant excess in data is observed above the expectation from standard model processes. The results are interpreted in the context of supersymmetric models with pair production of top squarks that decay either to a top quark and a neutralino or to a bottom quark and a chargino. For small mass values of the lightest supersymmetric particle, top-squark mass values up to around 650 GeV are excluded.

"  Optimal two-dimensional (2D), three-dimensional (3D) wave launching configurations are proposed for enhanced acceleration of charged particles in magnetized plasmas. A primary wave is launched obliquely with respect to the magnetic field and a secondary, low amplitude, wave is launched perpendicularly. The effect of both the launching angle of the primary wave, and the presence of the secondary wave is investigated. Theoretical predictions of the highest performances of the three-dimensional (3D) configurations are proposed using a Resonance Moments Method (RMM) based on estimates for the moments of the velocity distribution function calculated inside the resonance layers (RL). They suggest the existence of an optimal angle corresponding to non parallel launching. Direct statistical simulations show that it is possible to rise the mean electron velocity up to the order of magnitude as compared to the primary wave launching alone. It is a quite promising result because the amplitude of the secondary wave is ten times lower the one of the first wave. The parameters used are related to magnetic plasma fusion experiments in electron cyclotron resonance heating and electron acceleration in planetary ionospheres and magnetospheres.

Gaussian processes are used as flexible models for these functions and estimates are calculated directly from dense data sets using Gaussian process regression. We also develop an approximate expectation maximization algorithm to deal with the unobserved, latent dynamics between sparse observations. The posterior over states is approximated by a piecewise linearized process of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type and the maximum a posteriori estimation of the drift is facilitated by a sparse Gaussian process approximation.

"  Recently, it was shown that the coupling of center-of-mass and relative motion in atomic systems leads to inelastic confinement-induced resonances (ICIRs) [Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 073201 (2012)]. In the present work, the possible occurrence of ICIRs in quantum dots is investigated. Particularly, electron-hole and electron-electron two-body systems with long-range Coulomb interaction are considered using the material parameters of GaAs. ICIRs are identified for the electron-hole system verifying the universal nature of the ICIR and, additionally, resonances due to the coupling of center-of-mass and relative motion are found also for the electron-electron system. In analogy to the coherent molecule formation appearing at ICIR in atomic systems a significant change in the mean distance between electrons and holes at the resonance is observed. By using the redistribution of the particle densities at the resonance position in modern quantum-dot experiments, the ICIR can provide a new technique for the control of the electron distribution in quantum dots and for the generation of single photons on demand.

"  We establish the following fundamentals about Lagrangian models of meson-baryon interactions in the large-$N_{c}$ limit: 1. Calculating the leading-order contribution to $1$-meson/$2$-baryon Green's functions in the $1/N_c$ expansion involves summing an infinite class of divergent Feynman diagrams. So long as the bare Lagrangian properly obeys all large-$N_c$ selection rules, this all-loops resummation is accomplished exactly by solving coupled classical field equations with a short-distance cutoff. 2. The only effect of the resummation is to renormalize the bare Yukawa couplings, baryon masses and hyperfine baryon mass splittings of the model. 3. In the process, the large-$N_{c}$ renormalization group flow of these bare parameters is completely determined. We conjecture that variants of the Skyrme model emerge as UV fixed points of such flows. ","Solvability, Consistency and the Renormalization Group in Large-$N_c$   Models of Hadrons"
"  Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning have made significant strides in performance on applications such as Go and Atari games. However, developing practical methods to balance exploration and exploitation in complex domains remains largely unsolved. Thompson Sampling and its extension to reinforcement learning provide an elegant approach to exploration that only requires access to posterior samples of the model. At the same time, advances in approximate Bayesian methods have made posterior approximation for flexible neural network models practical. Thus, it is attractive to consider approximate Bayesian neural networks in a Thompson Sampling framework. To understand the impact of using an approximate posterior on Thompson Sampling, we benchmark well-established and recently developed methods for approximate posterior sampling combined with Thompson Sampling over a series of contextual bandit problems. We found that many approaches that have been successful in the supervised learning setting underperformed in the sequential decision-making scenario. In particular, we highlight the challenge of adapting slowly converging uncertainty estimates to the online setting.

"  This paper presents a novel end-to-end dynamic time-lapse video generation framework, named DTVNet, to generate diversified time-lapse videos from a single landscape image, which are conditioned on normalized motion vectors. The proposed DTVNet consists of two submodules: \emph{Optical Flow Encoder} (OFE) and \emph{Dynamic Video Generator} (DVG). The OFE maps a sequence of optical flow maps to a \emph{normalized motion vector} that encodes the motion information inside the generated video. The DVG contains motion and content streams that learn from the motion vector and the single image respectively, as well as an encoder and a decoder to learn shared content features and construct video frames with corresponding motion respectively. Specifically, the \emph{motion stream} introduces multiple \emph{adaptive instance normalization} (AdaIN) layers to integrate multi-level motion information that are processed by linear layers. In the testing stage, videos with the same content but various motion information can be generated by different \emph{normalized motion vectors} based on only one input image. We further conduct experiments on Sky Time-lapse dataset, and the results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art methods for generating high-quality and dynamic videos, as well as the variety for generating videos with various motion information.

"  We provide a constructive treatment of basic results in the theory of central simple algebras. One main issue is the fact that one starting result, Wedderburn's Theorem stating that a simple algebra is a matrix algebra over a skew field, is not constructively valid. We solve this problem by proving instead a dynamical version of this theorem. One can use this to give constructive proofs of basic results of the theory of central simple algebras, such as Skolem-Noether Theorem. We illustrate this development by giving an elementary constructive proof of a theorem of Becher (which is itself a consequence of a celebrated theorem of Merkurjev).

"  Methods that align distributions by minimizing an adversarial distance between them have recently achieved impressive results. However, these approaches are difficult to optimize with gradient descent and they often do not converge well without careful hyperparameter tuning and proper initialization. We investigate whether turning the adversarial min-max problem into an optimization problem by replacing the maximization part with its dual improves the quality of the resulting alignment and explore its connections to Maximum Mean Discrepancy. Our empirical results suggest that using the dual formulation for the restricted family of linear discriminators results in a more stable convergence to a desirable solution when compared with the performance of a primal min-max GAN-like objective and an MMD objective under the same restrictions. We test our hypothesis on the problem of aligning two synthetic point clouds on a plane and on a real-image domain adaptation problem on digits. In both cases, the dual formulation yields an iterative procedure that gives more stable and monotonic improvement over time.

"  We study the transport coefficients from the QCD Kondo effect in quark matter which contains heavy quarks as impurity particles. We estimate the coupling constant of the interaction between a light quark and a heavy quark at finite density and temperature by using the renormalization group equation up to two-loop order. We also estimate the coupling constant at zero temperature by using the mean-field approximation as non-perturbative treatment. To calculate the transport coefficients, we use the relativistic Boltzmann equation and apply the relaxation time approximation. We calculate the electric resistivity from the relativistic kinetic theory, and the viscosities from the relativistic hydrodynamics. We find that the electric resistivity is enhanced and the shear viscosity is suppressed due to the QCD Kondo effect at low temperature. ",Transport coefficients from QCD Kondo effect

"  The MAGIC telescopes are two Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes located on the canary island of La Palma.

More importantly, the experimentally measured ionization time of the second electrons [A. N.

"  We identify the fractions of supersymmetry preserved by the most general warped flux AdS and flat backgrounds in both massive and standard IIA supergravities.

"  With the development of Semantic Web, entity summarization has become an emerging task to generate concrete summaries for real world entities. To solve this problem, we propose an approach named MPSUM that extends a probabilistic topic model by integrating the idea of predicate-uniqueness and object-importance for ranking triples. The approach aims at generating brief but representative summaries for entities. We compare our approach with the state-of-the-art methods using DBpedia and LinkedMDB datasets.The experimental results show that our work improves the quality of entity summarization.

"  We consider harmonic Toeplitz operators $T_V = PV:{\mathcal H}(\Omega) \to {\mathcal H}(\Omega)$ where $P: L^2(\Omega) \to {\mathcal H}(\Omega)$ is the orthogonal projection onto ${\mathcal H}(\Omega) = \left\{u \in L^2(\Omega)\,|\,\Delta u = 0 \; \mbox{in}\;\Omega\right\}$, $\Omega \subset {\mathbb R}^d$, $d \geq 2$, is a bounded domain with $\partial \Omega \in C^\infty$, and $V: \Omega \to {\mathbb C}$ is a suitable multiplier. First, we complement the known criteria which guarantee that $T_V$ is in the $p$th Schatten-von Neumann class $S_p$, by sufficient conditions which imply $T_V \in S_{p, {\rm w}}$, the weak counterpart of $S_p$. Next, we assume that $\Omega$ is the unit ball in ${\mathbb R}^d$, and $V = \overline{V}$ is radially symmetric, and investigate the eigenvalue asymptotics of $T_V$ if $V$ has a power-like decay at $\partial \Omega$ or $V$ is compactly supported in $\Omega$. Further, we consider general $\Omega$ and $V \geq 0$ which is regular in $\Omega$, and admits a power-like decay of rate $\gamma > 0$ at $\partial \Omega$, and we show that in this case $T_V$ is unitarily equivalent to a pseudo-differential operator of order $-\gamma$, self-adjoint in $L^2(\partial \Omega)$. Using this unitary equivalence, we obtain the main asymptotic term of the eigenvalue counting function for the operator $T_V$. Finally, we introduce the Krein Laplacian $K \geq 0$, self-adjoint in $L^2(\Omega)$; it is known that ${\rm Ker}\,K = {\mathcal H}(\Omega)$, and the zero eigenvalue of $K$ is isolated. We perturb $K$ by $V \in C(\overline{\Omega};{\mathbb R})$, and show that $\sigma_{\rm ess}(K+V) = V(\partial \Omega)$. Assuming that $V \geq 0$ and $V{|\partial \Omega} = 0$, we study the asymptotic distribution of the eigenvalues of $K \pm V$ near the origin, and find that the effective Hamiltonian which governs this distribution is the Toeplitz operator $T_V$.

"  We discuss how the centres of galaxy clusters evolve in time, showing the results of a series of direct N-body simulations. In particular, we followed the evolution of a galaxy cluster with a mass $M_{clus} \simeq 10^{14} $M$_{\odot}$ in different configurations. The dynamical evolution of the system leads in all the cases to the formation of dense and massive sub-structures in the cluster centre, that form in consequence of a series of collisions and merging among galaxies travelling in the cluster core. We investigate how the structural properties of the main merging product depends on the characteristics of those galaxies that contributed to its formation.

"  Gaussian states, operations, and measurements are central building blocks for continuous-variable quantum information processing which paves the way for abundant applications, especially including network-based quantum computation and communication. To make the most use of the Gaussian processes, it is required to understand and utilize suitable mathematical tools such as the symplectic space, symplectic algebra, and Wigner representation. Applying these mathematical tools to practical quantum scenarios, we developed various schemes for quantum transduction, interference-based bosonic mode permutation and bosonic sensing. We demonstrated that generic coupler characterized by Gaussian unitary process can be transformed into a high-fidelity transducer, assuming the access to infinite squeezing and adaptive feedforward with homodyne measurements. To address the practical limitation of finite squeezing, we explored the interference-based protocols. These protocols let us freely permute bosonic modes only assuming the access to single-mode Gaussian operations and multiple uses of a given multi-mode Gaussian process. Thus, such a scheme not only enables universal decoupling for bosonic systems, which is useful for suppressing undesired coupling between the system and the environment, but also faithful bidirectional single-mode quantum transduction. Moreover, noticing that the Gaussian processes are appropriate theoretical models for optical sensors, we studied the quantum noise theory for optical parameter sensing and its potential in providing great measurement precision enhancement. We also extended the Gaussian theories to discrete variable systems, with several examples such as quantum (gate) teleportation. All the analyses originated from the fundamental quantum commutation relations, and therefore are widely applicable. ",Properties and Application of Gaussian Quantum Processes
"  We show that the gravitational wave source counts distribution can test how gravitational radiation propagates on cosmological scales. This test does not require obtaining redshifts for the sources. If the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR, $\rho$) from a gravitational wave source is proportional to the strain then it falls as $R^{-1}$, thus we expect the source counts to follow $dN/d\rho \propto \rho^{-4}$. However, if gravitational waves decay as they propagate or propagate into other dimensions, then there can be deviations from this generic prediction. We consider the possibility that the strain falls as $R^{-\gamma}$, where $\gamma=1$ recovers the expected predictions in a Euclidean uniformly-filled universe, and forecast the sensitivity of future observations to deviations from standard General Relativity. We first consider the case of few objects, 7 sources, with a signal-to-noise from 8 to 24, and impose a lower limit on $\gamma$, finding $\gamma>0.33$ at $95\%$ confidence level. The distribution of our simulated sample is very consistent with the distribution of the trigger events reported by Advanced LIGO. Future measurements will improve these constraints: with 100 events, we estimate that $\gamma$ can be measured with an uncertainty of $15\%$. We generalize the formalism to account for a range of chirp masses and the possibility that the signal falls as $\exp(-R/R_0)/R^\gamma$. ",Testing Gravity with Gravitational Wave Source Counts
"  Using new and archival observations made with the Swift satellite and other facilities, we examine 147 X-ray sources selected from the ROSAT All-Sky-Survey Bright Source Catalog (RASS/BSC) to produce a new limit on the number of isolated neutron stars (INSs) in the RASS/BSC, the most constraining such limit to-date. Independent of X-ray spectrum and variability, the number of INSs is <=48 (90% confidence). Restricting attention to soft (having an effective temperature of < 200 eV), non-variable X-ray sources -- as in a previous study -- yields an all-sky limit of <=31 INSs. In the course of our analysis, we identify five new high-quality INS candidates for targeted follow-up observations. A future all-sky X-ray survey with eROSITA, or another mission with similar capabilities, can be expected to increase the detected population of X-ray-discovered INSs from the 8 to 50 in the BSC, to (for a disk population) 240 to 1500, which will enable a more detailed study of neutron star population models.

"  We examine the structure of families of distortion balls from the perspective of Kolmogorov complexity. Special attention is paid to the canonical rate-distortion function of a source word which returns the minimal Kolmogorov complexity of all distortion balls containing that word subject to a bound on their cardinality. This canonical rate-distortion function is related to the more standard algorithmic rate-distortion function for the given distortion measure. Examples are given of list distortion, Hamming distortion, and Euclidean distortion. The algorithmic rate-distortion function can behave differently from Shannon's rate-distortion function. To this end, we show that the canonical rate-distortion function can and does assume a wide class of shapes (unlike Shannon's); we relate low algorithmic mutual information to low Kolmogorov complexity (and consequently suggest that certain aspects of the mutual information formulation of Shannon's rate-distortion function behave differently than would an analogous formulation using algorithmic mutual information); we explore the notion that low Kolmogorov complexity distortion balls containing a given word capture the interesting properties of that word (which is hard to formalize in Shannon's theory) and this suggests an approach to denoising; and, finally, we show that the different behavior of the rate-distortion curves of individual source words to some extent disappears after averaging over the source words.

"  A new method to investigate a possible time-dependence of the dark energy equation of state $w$ is proposed. We apply this methodology to two of the most recent data sets of type Ia supernova (Union2 and SDSS) and the baryon acoustic oscillation peak at $z = 0.35$. For some combinations of these data, we show that there is a clear departure from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model at intermediary redshifts, although a non-evolving dark energy component ($dw/dz = 0$) cannot be ruled out by these data. The approach developed here may be useful to probe a possible evolving dark energy component when applied to upcoming observational data. ",Probing the time dependence of dark energy
"  The oral traditions of Aboriginal cultures across Australia contain references to the presence of multiple Suns in the sky at the same time. Explanations of this have been largely regarded as symbolic or mythological, rather than observations of natural phenomena. In this paper, we examine oral traditions describing multiple Suns and analyse interpretations that could explain them. Our analysis of the oral traditions concludes that descriptions of multiple Suns fall into two main categories: one describing the changes in the path of the Sun throughout the year, and the other describing observations of parhelia, an atmospheric phenomenon known as 'Sun dogs' that creates an optical illusion of multiple Suns in the sky at once. This analysis shows how Aboriginal people pay close attention to natural phenomena, assign them social meaning, and incorporate them into oral tradition.

"  Global equilibrium fragmentation inside a freeze out constraining volume is a working hypothesis widely used in nuclear fragmentation statistical models. In the framework of classical Lennard Jones molecular dynamics, we study how the relaxation of the fixed volume constraint affects the posterior evolution of microscopic correlations, and how a non-confined fragmentation scenario is established. A study of the dynamical evolution of the relative kinetic energy fluctuations was also performed. We found that asymptotic measurements of such observable can be related to the number of decaying channels available to the system at fragmentation time.

"  Broad disagreement persists between helioseismological observables and predictions of solar models computed with the latest surface abundances. Here we show that most of these problems can be solved by the presence of asymmetric dark matter coupling to nucleons as the square of the momentum $q$ exchanged in the collision. We compute neutrino fluxes, small frequency separations, surface helium abundances, sound speed profiles and convective zone depths for a number of models, showing more than a $6\sigma$ preference for $q^2$ models over others, and over the Standard Solar Model. The preferred mass (3\,GeV) and reference dark matter-nucleon cross-section ($10^{-37}$\,cm$^2$ at $q_0 = 40$\,MeV) are within the region of parameter space allowed by both direct detection and collider searches.

"  Following arXiv:1012.2107 we show that in global de Sitter space its isometry is broken by the loop IR divergences for any invariant vacuum state of the massive scalars. We derive kinetic equation in global de Sitter space. It follows from the Dyson-Schwinger equation of the Schwinger-Keldysh diagrammatic technique in IR limit and allows to understand the physical meaning and consequences of the loop IR divergences. In many respects the isometry breaking in global dS is similar to the one in the contracting Poincare patch of de Sitter space. Hence, as a warm up exercise we study the kinetic equation and properties of its solutions in the expanding and contracting Poincare patches of de Sitter space. Quite unexpectedly we find that under some initial conditions there is an explosive production of massive particles in the expanding Poincare patch.

"  We exploit cosmological-model independent measurements of the expansion history of the Universe to provide a cosmic distance ladder. These are supernovae type Ia used as standard candles (at redshift between 0.01 and 1.3) and baryon acoustic oscillations (at redshifts between 0.1 and 0.8) as standard rulers. We calibrate (anchor) the ladder in two ways: first using the local $H_0$ value as an anchor at $z$ = 0 (effectively calibrating the standard candles) and secondly using the cosmic microwave background-inferred sound-horizon scale as an anchor (giving the standard ruler length) as an inverse distance ladder. Both methods are consistent, but the uncertainty in the expansion history $H(z)$ is smaller if the sound horizon scale is used. We present inferred values for the sound horizon at radiation drag $r_d$ which do not rely on assumptions about the early expansion history nor on cosmic microwave background measurements but on the cosmic distance ladder and baryon acoustic oscillations measurements. We also present derived values of $H_0$ from the inverse distance ladder and we show that they are in very good agreement with the extrapolated value in a $\Lambda$CDM model from Planck cosmic microwave background data.

"  We construct and analyse a simple {\em reduced} model to study the effects of the interplay between a density undergoing an active-to-absorbing state phase transition (AAPT) and a fluctuating environment in the form of a broken symmetry mode coupled to the density field in any arbitrary dimension. We show, by using perturbative renormalisation group calculations, that {\em both} the effects of the environment on the density and the latter's feedback on the environment influence the ensuing universal scaling behaviour of the AAPT at its extinction transition. Phenomenological implications of our results in the context of more realistic natural examples are discussed.

"  Recently a remarkable connection has been proposed between the fluctuating hydrodynamic equations of a one-dimensional fluid and the Kardar-Parizi-Zhang (KPZ) equation for interface growth. This connection has been used to relate equilibrium correlation functions of the fluid to KPZ correlation functions. Here we use this connection to compute the exact cumulant generating function for energy current in the fluid system. This leads to exact expressions for all cumulants and in particular to universal results for certain combinations of the cumulants. As examples, we consider two different systems which are expected to be in different universality classes, namely a hard particle gas with Hamiltonian dynamics and a harmonic chain with momentum conserving stochastic dynamics. Simulations provide excellent confirmation of our theory. ",Energy current cumulants in one-dimensional systems in equilibrium
"  The baryon acoustic oscillations are a promising route to the precision measure of the cosmological distance scale and hence the measurement of the time evolution of dark energy. We show that the non-linear degradation of the acoustic signature in the correlations of low-redshift galaxies is a correctable process. By suitable reconstruction of the linear density field, one can sharpen the acoustic peak in the correlation function or, equivalently, restore the higher harmonics of the oscillations in the power spectrum. With this, one can achieve better measurements of the acoustic scale for a given survey volume. Reconstruction is particularly effective at low redshift, where the non-linearities are worse but where the dark energy density is highest. At z=0.3, we find that one can reduce the sample variance error bar on the acoustic scale by at least a factor of 2 and in principle by nearly a factor of 4. We discuss the significant implications our results have for the design of galaxy surveys aimed at measuring the distance scale through the acoustic peak.

"  We present a detailed comparison between the latest observational data on the kinematical structure of the core of M15, obtained with the Hubble STIS and WFPC2 instruments, and the results of dynamical simulations carried out using the special-purpose GRAPE-6 computer. The observations imply the presence of a significant amount of dark matter in the cluster core. In our dynamical simulations, neutron stars and/or massive white dwarfs concentrate to the center through mass segregation, resulting in a sharp increase in $M/L$ toward the center. While consistent with the presence of a central black hole, the Hubble data can also be explained by this central concentration of stellar-mass compact objects. The latter interpretation is more conservative, since such remnants result naturally from stellar evolution, although runaway merging leading to the formation of a black hole may also occur for some range of initial conditions. We conclude that no central massive object is required to explain the observational data, although we cannot conclusively exclude such an object at the level of $\sim500-1000$ solar masses. Our findings are unchanged when we reduce the assumed neutron-star retention fraction in our simulations from 100% to 0%. ",On the central structure of M15
"  Using response theory, we calculate the charge-current vortex generated by spin pumping at a point-like contact in a system with Rashba spin-orbit coupling. We discuss the spatial profile of the current density for finite temperature and for the zero-temperature limit. The main observation is that the Rashba spin precession leads to a charge current that oscillates as a function of the distance from the spin-pumping source, which is confirmed by numerical simulations. In our calculations, we consider a Rashba model on a square lattice, for which we first review the basic properties related to charge and spin transport. In particular, we define the charge- and spin-current operators for the tight-binding Hamiltonian as the currents coupled linearly with the U(1) and SU(2) gauge potentials, respectively. By analogy to the continuum model, the spin-orbit-coupling Hamiltonian on the lattice is then introduced as the generator of the spin current.

"  Algorithm configurators are automated methods to optimise the parameters of an algorithm for a class of problems. We evaluate the performance of a simple random local search configurator (ParamRLS) for tuning the neighbourhood size $k$ of the RLS$_k$ algorithm. We measure performance as the expected number of configuration evaluations required to identify the optimal value for the parameter. We analyse the impact of the cutoff time $\kappa$ (the time spent evaluating a configuration for a problem instance) on the expected number of configuration evaluations required to find the optimal parameter value, where we compare configurations using either best found fitness values (ParamRLS-F) or optimisation times (ParamRLS-T). We consider tuning RLS$_k$ for a variant of the Ridge function class (Ridge*), where the performance of each parameter value does not change during the run, and for the OneMax function class, where longer runs favour smaller $k$. We rigorously prove that ParamRLS-F efficiently tunes RLS$_k$ for Ridge* for any $\kappa$ while ParamRLS-T requires at least quadratic $\kappa$. For OneMax ParamRLS-F identifies $k=1$ as optimal with linear $\kappa$ while ParamRLS-T requires a $\kappa$ of at least $\Omega(n\log n)$. For smaller $\kappa$ ParamRLS-F identifies that $k>1$ performs better while ParamRLS-T returns $k$ chosen uniformly at random.

"  Large scale real number computation is an essential ingredient in several modern mathematical proofs. Because such lengthy computations cannot be verified by hand, some mathematicians want to use software proof assistants to verify the correctness of these proofs. This paper develops a new implementation of the constructive real numbers and elementary functions for such proofs by using the monad properties of the completion operation on metric spaces. Bishop and Bridges's notion of regular sequences is generalized to, what I call, regular functions which form the completion of any metric space. Using the monad operations, continuous functions on length spaces (a common subclass of metric spaces) are created by lifting continuous functions on the original space. A prototype Haskell implementation has been created. I believe that this approach yields a real number library that is reasonably efficient for computation, and still simple enough to easily verify its correctness.

"  Given a non-associative unital ring $R$, a monoid $G$ and a set $\pi$ of additive maps $R \rightarrow R$, we introduce the Ore monoid ring $R[\pi ; G]$, and, in a special case, the differential monoid ring. We show that these structures generalize, in a natural way, not only the classical Ore extensions and differential polynomial rings, but also the constructions, introduced by Cojuhari, defined by so-called $D$-structures $\pi$. Moreover, for commutative monoids, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for differential monoid rings to be simple. We use this in a special case to obtain new and shorter proofs of classical simplicity results for differential polynomial rings in several variables previously obtained by Voskoglou and Malm by other means. We also give examples of new Ore-like structures defined by finite commutative monoids. ",Simplicity of Ore monoid rings

"  Some of the greatest advances in web search have come from leveraging socio-economic properties of online user behavior. Past advances include PageRank, anchor text, hubs-authorities, and TF-IDF. In this paper, we investigate another socio-economic property that, to our knowledge, has not yet been exploited: sites that create lists of entities, such as IMDB and Netflix, have an incentive to avoid gratuitous duplicates. We leverage this property to resolve entities across the different web sites, and find that we can obtain substantial improvements in resolution accuracy. This improvement in accuracy also translates into robustness, which often reduces the amount of training data that must be labeled for comparing entities across many sites. Furthermore, the technique provides robustness when resolving sites that have some duplicates, even without first removing these duplicates. We present algorithms with very strong precision and recall, and show that max weight matching, while appearing to be a natural choice turns out to have poor performance in some situations. The presented techniques are now being used in the back-end entity resolution system at a major Internet search engine. ",Improving Entity Resolution with Global Constraints

"  Suppose that $m$ drivers each choose a preferred parking space in a linear car park with $n$ spots. In order, each driver goes to their chosen spot and parks there if possible, and otherwise takes the next available spot if it exists. If all drivers park successfully, the sequence of choices is called a parking function. Classical parking functions correspond to the case $m=n$; we study here combinatorial and probabilistic aspects of this generalized case.   We construct a family of bijections between parking functions $\text{PF}(m, n)$ with $m$ cars and $n$ spots and spanning forests $\mathscr{F}(n+1, n+1-m)$ with $n+1$ vertices and $n+1-m$ distinct trees having specified roots. This leads to a bijective correspondence between $\text{PF}(m, n)$ and monomial terms in the associated Tutte polynomial of a disjoint union of $n-m+1$ complete graphs. We present an identity between the ""inversion enumerator"" of spanning forests with fixed roots and the ""displacement enumerator"" of parking functions. The displacement is then related to the number of graphs on $n+1$ labeled vertices with a fixed number of edges, where the graph has $n+1-m$ disjoint rooted components with specified roots.   We investigate various probabilistic properties of a uniform parking function, giving a formula for the law of a single coordinate. As a side result we obtain a recurrence relation for the displacement enumerator. Adapting known results on random linear probes, we further deduce the covariance between two coordinates when $m=n$.

"  Markov chain Monte Carlo is a method of producing a correlated sample in order to estimate features of a target distribution via ergodic averages. A fundamental question is when should sampling stop? That is, when are the ergodic averages good estimates of the desired quantities? We consider a method that stops the simulation when the width of a confidence interval based on an ergodic average is less than a user-specified value. Hence calculating a Monte Carlo standard error is a critical step in assessing the simulation output.

"  The link between the dynamical evolution of the giant planets and the Kuiper Belt orbital structure can provide clues and insight about the dynamical history of the Solar System. The classical region of the Kuiper Belt has two populations (the cold and hot populations) with completely different physical and dynamical properties. These properties have been explained in the framework of a subset of the simulations of the Nice Model, in which Neptune remained on a low-eccentricity orbit (Neptune's eccentricity is never larger than 0.1) throughout the giant planet instability. However, recent simulations have showed that the remaining Nice model simulations, in which Neptune temporarily acquires a large-eccentricity orbit (larger than 0.1), are also consistent with the preservation of the cold population (inclination smaller than 4 degrees), if the latter formed in situ. However, the resulting a cold population showed in many of the simulations eccentricities larger than those observed for the real population. We focus on a short period of time which is characterized by Neptune's large eccentricity and a slow precession of Neptune's perihelion. We show that if self-gravity is considered in the disk, the precession rate of the particles longitude of perihelion is slowed down. This, combined with the effect of mutual scattering among the bodies, which spreads all orbital elements, allows some objects to return to low eccentricities. However, we show that if the cold population originally had a small total mass, this effect is negligible. Thus, we conclude that the only possibilities to keep at low eccentricity some cold-population objects during a high-eccentricity phase of Neptune are that (i) either Neptune's precession was rapid, as suggested by Batygin et al. (2011) or (ii) Neptune's slow precession phase was long enough to allow some particles to experience a full secular cycle.

"  We use a modification of the parameterization method to study invariant manifolds for difference equations. We establish existence, regularity, smooth dependence on parameters and study several singular limits, even if the difference equations do not define a dynamical system. This method also leads to efficient algorithms that we present with their implementations. The manifolds we consider include not only the classical strong stable and unstable manifolds but also manifolds associated to non-resonant spaces.   When the difference equations are the Euler-Lagrange equations of a discrete variational we present sharper results. Note that, if the Legendre condition fails, the Euler-Lagrange equations can not be treated as a dynamical system. If the Legendre condition becomes singular, the dynamical system may be singular while the difference equation remains regular.   We present numerical applications to several examples in the physics literature: the Frenkel-Kontorova model with long-range interactions and the Heisenberg model of spin chains with a perturbation. We also present extensions to finite differentiable difference equations. ",Invariant manifolds for analytic difference equations
"  In this paper, we mainly study the gradient based Jacobi-type algorithms to maximize two classes of homogeneous polynomials with orthogonality constraints, and establish their convergence properties. For the first class of homogeneous polynomials subject to a constraint on a Stiefel manifold, we reformulate it as an optimization problem on a unitary group, which makes it possible to apply the gradient based Jacobi-type (Jacobi-G) algorithm. Then, if the subproblem can be always represented as a quadratic form, we establish the global convergence of Jacobi-G under any one of the three conditions (A1), (A2) and (A3). The convergence result for (A1) is an easy extension of the result in [Usevich et al. SIOPT 2020], while (A2) and (A3) are two new ones. This algorithm and the convergence properties apply to the well-known joint approximate symmetric tensor diagonalization and joint approximate symmetric trace maximization. For the second class of homogeneous polynomials subject to constraints on the product of Stiefel manifolds, we similarly reformulate it as an optimization problem on the product of unitary groups, and then develop a new gradient based multi-block Jacobi-type (Jacobi-MG) algorithm to solve it. We similarly establish the global convergence of Jacobi-MG under any one of the three conditions (A1), (A2) and (A3), if the subproblem can be always represented as a quadratic form. This algorithm and the convergence properties apply to the well-known joint approximate tensor diagonalization and joint approximate tensor compression. As the proximal variants of Jacobi-G and Jacobi-MG, we also propose the Jacobi-GP and Jacobi-MGP algorithms, and establish their global convergence without any further condition. Some numerical results are provided indicating the efficiency of the proposed algorithms.

"  Let $E$ and $F$ be Banach lattices. We show first that the disjointness preserving linear functionals separate the points of any infinite dimensional Banach lattice $E$, which shows that in this case the unbounded disjointness operators from $E\to F$ separate the points of $E$. Then we show that every disjointness preserving operator $T:E\to F$ is norm bounded on an order dense ideal. In case $E$ has order continuous norm, this implies that that every unbounded disjointness preserving map $T:E\to F$ has a unique decomposition $T=R+S$, where $R$ is a bounded disjointness preserving operator and $S$ is an unbounded disjointness preserving operator, which is zero on a norm dense ideal. For the case that $E=C(X)$, with $X$ a compact Hausdorff space, we show that every disjointness preserving operator $T:C(X)\to F$ is norm bounded on an norm dense sublattice algebra of $C(X)$, which leads then to a decomposition of $T$ into a bounded disjointness operator and a finite sum of unbounded disjointness preserving operators, which are zero on order dense ideals.

"  Magnetohydrodynamic turbulence is a ubiquitous phenomenon in solar physics, plasma physics and astrophysics and governs many properties of the flows of well-conductive fluids. Recently, conflicting spectral slopes for the inertial range of MHD turbulence has been reported by different groups. Varying spectral shapes from earlier simulations hinted at a wider spectral locality of MHD, which necessitated higher resolution simulations and careful and rigorous numerical analysis. In this Letter we present two groups of simulations with resolution up to 4096^3 that are numerically well-resolved and has been analyzed with exact and well-tested method of scaling study. Our results from both simulation groups indicate that the power spectral slope for all energy-related quantities, such as total energy and residual energy are around -1.7, close to Kolmogorov's -5/3. This suggests that residual energy is the constant fraction, 0.15+-0.03 of the total energy and that in asymptotic regime magnetic and kinetic spectra have the same scaling. The -1.5 slope for energy and -2 slope for residual energy suggested by other groups seems to be completely inconsistent with numerics.

Our sample contains two stars with RV variations of >1000 m/s. While we require more measurements to determine whether these RV variations are due to unseen planetary or stellar companions or are the result of starspots known to plague the surface of M dwarfs, we can place upper limits of <40 MJsini on the masses of any companions around those two M dwarfs with RV variations of <160 m/s at orbital periods of 10-100 days.

"  Style transfer is the process of rendering one image with some content in the style of another image, representing the style. Recent studies of Liu et al. (2017) show that traditional style transfer methods of Gatys et al. (2016) and Johnson et al. (2016) fail to reproduce the depth of the content image, which is critical for human perception. They suggest to preserve the depth map by additional regularizer in the optimized loss function, forcing preservation of the depth map. However these traditional methods are either computationally inefficient or require training a separate neural network for each style. AdaIN method of Huang et al. (2017) allows efficient transferring of arbitrary style without training a separate model but is not able to reproduce the depth map of the content image. We propose an extension to this method, allowing depth map preservation by applying variable stylization strength. Qualitative analysis and results of user evaluation study indicate that the proposed method provides better stylizations, compared to the original AdaIN style transfer method.

"  We explain how to find the asymptotic form of fixed point solutions in functional truncations, in particular $f(R)$ approximations. We find that quantum fluctuations do not decouple at large $R$, typically leading to elaborate asymptotic solutions containing several free parameters. By a counting argument, these can be used to map out the dimension of the fixed point solution spaces. They are also necessary to validate the numerical solution, and provide the physical part in the limit that the cutoff is removed: the fixed point equation of state. As an example we apply the techniques to a recent $f(R)$ approximation by Demmel et al, finding asymptotic matches to their numerical solution. Depending on the value of the endomorphism parameter, we find many other asymptotic solutions and fixed point solution spaces of differing dimensions, yielding several alternative scenarios for the equation of state. Asymptotic studies of other $f(R)$ approximations are needed to clarify the picture. ",Asymptotic solutions in asymptotic safety

"  Audio source separation is the process of separating a mixture (e.g. a pop band recording) into isolated sounds from individual sources (e.g. just the lead vocals). Deep learning models are the state-of-the-art in source separation, given that the mixture to be separated is similar to the mixtures the deep model was trained on. This requires the end user to know enough about each model's training to select the correct model for a given audio mixture. In this work, we automate selection of the appropriate model for an audio mixture. We present a confidence measure that does not require ground truth to estimate separation quality, given a deep model and audio mixture. We use this confidence measure to automatically select the model output with the best predicted separation quality. We compare our confidence-based ensemble approach to using individual models with no selection, to an oracle that always selects the best model and to a random model selector. Results show our confidence-based ensemble significantly outperforms the random ensemble over general mixtures and approaches oracle performance for music mixtures.

Using the string net wavefunction, we describe the properties of this phase. Our discussion is informed by mappings of string net wavefunctions to the chromatic polynomial and the Potts model.

"  Counterfactual evaluation can estimate Click-Through-Rate (CTR) differences between ranking systems based on historical interaction data, while mitigating the effect of position bias and item-selection bias. We introduce the novel Logging-Policy Optimization Algorithm (LogOpt), which optimizes the policy for logging data so that the counterfactual estimate has minimal variance. As minimizing variance leads to faster convergence, LogOpt increases the data-efficiency of counterfactual estimation. LogOpt turns the counterfactual approach - which is indifferent to the logging policy - into an online approach, where the algorithm decides what rankings to display. We prove that, as an online evaluation method, LogOpt is unbiased w.r.t. position and item-selection bias, unlike existing interleaving methods. Furthermore, we perform large-scale experiments by simulating comparisons between thousands of rankers. Our results show that while interleaving methods make systematic errors, LogOpt is as efficient as interleaving without being biased.

"  Many tools and libraries are readily available to build and operate distributed Web applications. While the setup of operational environments is comparatively easy, practice shows that their continuous secure operation is more difficult to achieve, many times resulting in vulnerable systems exposed to the Internet.

"  Using exact calculations, we elucidate the significance of the surface (bound) states for the thermal Casimir interactions for an Ising strip with a finite width. The surface state arises whenever an imaginary wavenumber mode appears in the spectrum of the transfer matrix, taken in the direction parallel to the edges of the strip. Depending on the boundary conditions, the imaginary modes emerge below or above the bulk critical temperature, or below the wetting temperature of a single surface with surface magnetic field. The bound states are responsible for the strong asymmetry of the Casimir forces between the super- and sub-critical regimes and for their sign. Our analysis uses the fact that the Casimir forces have two mathematical forms. We show that these very different representation are the same and in the process find the origin of the asymmetry.

"  The onset of generalized synchronization of chaos in directionally-coupled systems corresponds to the formation of a continuous mapping which enables one to persistently define the state of the response system from the trajectory of the drive system. The recently developed theory of generalized synchronization of chaos deals only with the case where this synchronization mapping is a single-valued function. In this paper, we explore generalized synchronization in a regime where the synchronization mapping can become a multi-valued function. Specifically, we study the properties of the multi-valued mapping which occurs between the drive and response systems when the systems are synchronized with a frequency ratio other than one-to-one, and address the issues of the existence and continuity of such mappings. The basic theoretical framework underlying the considered synchronization regimes is then developed. ",Multi-valued mappings in generalized chaos synchronization

Although equisingular deformations of plane curve singularities are very well understood, we believe that this aspect may give a new insight in their inner structure.

"  Defining the Inclusion/Exclusion (I/E) criteria of a trial is one of the most important steps during a trial design. Increasingly complex I/E criteria potentially create information imbalance and transparency issues between the people who design and run the trials and those who consume the information produced by the trials. In order to better understand and quantify the impact of a category of I/E criteria on observed treatment effects, a concept, named the Selection Induced Contrast Estimate (SICE) effect, is introduced and formulated in this paper. The SICE effect can exist in controlled clinical trials when treatment affects the correlation between a marker used for selection and the response of interest. This effect is demonstrated with both simulations and real clinical trial data. Although the statistical elements behind the SICE effect have been well studied, explicitly formulating and studying this effect can benefit several areas, including better transparency in I/E criteria, meta-analysis of multiple clinical trials, treatment effect interpretation in real-world medical practice, etc. ",Selection Induced Contrast Estimate (SICE) Effect: An Attempt to   Quantify the Impact of Some Patient Selection Criteria in Randomized Clinical   Trials
"  Using two crystals for spontaneous parametric down-conversion in a parallel setup, we observe two-photon interference with high visibility. The high visibility is consistent with complementarity and the absence of which-path information. The observations are explained as effects of entanglement or equivalently in terms of interfering probability amplitudes, and also by the calculation of a second-order field correlation function in the Heisenberg picture. The latter approach brings out explicitly the role of the vacuum fields in the down-conversion at the crystals and in the photon coincidence counting. For comparison we show that the Hong-Ou-Mandel dip can be explained by the same approach in which the role of the vacuum signal and idler fields, as opposed to entanglement involving vacuum states, is emphasized.

"  There have been a number of suggestions that the r = 0 singularity of a spherically symmetric (uncharged) evaporating black hole can be circumvented by a quantum transition to a white hole, which eventually releases all trapped quantum information, consistent with overall unitary evolution of the quantum fields. Some of these scenarios rely on loop quantum gravity to impose a minimum area of two-spheres, but are quite vague on how to deal with black hole evaporation, particularly its endpoint. In this paper I present a rather complete toy model for the evolution of the geometry and the effective stress-energy tensor derived from the geometry via the classical Einstein equations. Modifications of the Schwarzschild geometry once the formation of the black hole is complete are very small outside regions of high curvature, and the curvature never becomes super-Planckian. The evolution of the white hole is roughlythe time reverse of the formation and evaporation of the black hole. The mass of the white hole increases as it gradually emits the negative energy that flowed into the black hole during its evaporation until the matter and radiaton that collapsed to form the black hole emerges and the white hole disappears. I consider the compatibility of the model with some of the quantum energy condition proposed in the literature, and the implications for the interpretation of black hole entropy.

"  Confined electron spins are preferred candidates for embodying quantum information in the solid state. A popular idea is the use of optical excitation to achieve the ``best of both worlds'', i.e. marrying the long spin decoherence times with rapid gating. Here we study an all-optical adiabatic approach to generating single qubit phase gates. We find that such a gate can be extremely robust against the combined effect of all principal sources of decoherence, with an achievable fidelity of 0.999 even at finite temperature. Crucially this performance can be obtained with only a small time cost: the adiabatic gate duration is within about an order of magnitude of a simple dynamic implementation. An experimental verification of these predictions is immediately feasible with only modest resources.

"  The Orion Molecular Cloud is the nearest massive-star forming region. Massive stars have profound effects on their environment due to their strong radiation fields and stellar winds. Velocity-resolved observations of the [CII] $158\,\mu\mathrm{m}$ fine-structure line allow us to study the kinematics of UV-illuminated gas. Here, we present a square-degree-sized map of [CII] emission from the Orion Nebula complex obtained by the upGREAT instrument onboard SOFIA, covering the entire Orion Nebula (M42) plus M43 and the nebulae NGC 1973, 1975, and 1977. We compare the stellar characteristics of these three regions with the kinematics of the expanding bubbles surrounding them. The bubble blown by the O7V star $\theta^1$ Ori C in the Orion Nebula expands rapidly, at $13\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. Simple analytical models reproduce the characteristics of the hot interior gas and the neutral shell of this wind-blown bubble and give us an estimate of the expansion time of $0.2\,\mathrm{Myr}$. M43 with the B0.5V star NU Ori also exhibits an expanding bubble structure, with an expansion velocity of $6\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. Comparison with analytical models for the pressure-driven expansion of H\,{\sc ii} regions gives an age estimate of $0.02\,\mathrm{Myr}$. The bubble surrounding NGC 1973, 1975, and 1977 with the central B1V star 42 Orionis expands at $1.5\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, likely due to the over-pressurized ionized gas as in the case of M43. We derive an age of $0.4\,\mathrm{Myr}$ for this structure. We conclude that the bubble of the Orion Nebula is driven by the mechanical energy input by the strong stellar wind from $\theta^1$ Ori C, while the bubbles associated with M43 and NGC 1977 are caused by the thermal expansion of the gas ionized by their central later-type massive stars.

"  Given the compositional diversity of asteroids, and their distribution in space, it is impossible to consider returning samples from each one to establish their origin. However, the velocity and molecular composition of primary minerals, hydrated silicates, and organic materials can be determined by in situ dust detector instruments. Such instruments could sample the cloud of micrometer-scale particles shed by asteroids to provide direct links to known meteorite groups without returning the samples to terrestrial laboratories. We extend models of the measured lunar dust cloud from LADEE to show that the abundance of detectable impact-generated microsamples around asteroids is a function of the parent body radius, heliocentric distance, flyby distance, and speed. We use monte carlo modeling to show that several tens to hundreds of particles, if randomly ejected and detected during a flyby, would be a sufficient number to classify the parent body as an ordinary chondrite, basaltic achondrite, or other class of meteorite. Encountering and measuring microsamples shed from near-earth and main-belt asteroids, coupled with complementary imaging and multispectral measurements, could accomplish a thorough characterization of small, airless bodies.

"  Double-barred galaxies are common in the local Universe, with approximately one third of barred spirals hosting an smaller, inner bar. Nested bars have been proposed as a mechanism for transporting gas to the very central regions of the galaxy, trigger star formation and contribute to the growth of the bulge. To test this idea, we perform for the first time a detailed analysis of the photometry, kinematics and stellar populations of a double-barred galaxy: NGC 357. We find that this galaxy is either hosting a pseudobulge or a classical bulge together with an inner disc. We compare the relative mean luminosity-weighted age, metallicity and alpha-enhancement between the (pseudo)bulge, inner bar and outer bar, finding that the three structures are nearly coeval and old. Moreover, the bulge and inner bar present the same metallicity and overabundance, whereas the outer bar tends to be less metal-rich and more alpha-enhanced. These results point out that, rather than the classical secular scenario in which gas and star formation play a major role, the redistribution of the existing stars is driving the formation of the inner structures.

We show that such procedure terminates, that is, the rational sum exists, when all the cyclic submodules decomposing $N$ are annihilated by monomial right ideals whose monomials define regular formal languages. The method is based on the iterative application of the colon right ideal operation to monomial ideals which are given by an eventual infinite basis. By using automata theory, we prove that the number of these iterations is a minimal one.

Briefly summarized it states that the random transfer matrices placed into a normal system of coordinates act on the isotropic frames and lead to a Markov process with a unique invariant measure which is of geometric nature. On the elliptic part of the transfer matrices, this measure is invariant under the full hermitian symplectic group of the universality class under study. While the random phase property can up to now only be proved in special models or in a restricted sense, we provide strong numerical evidence that it holds in the Anderson model of localization. A main outcome of the random phase property is a perturbative calculation of the Lyapunov exponents which shows that the Lyapunov spectrum is equidistant and that the localization lengths for large systems in the unitary, orthogonal and symplectic ensemble differ by a factor 2 each. In an Anderson-Ando model on a tubular geometry with magnetic field and spin-orbit coupling, the normal system of coordinates is calculated and this is used to derive explicit energy dependent formulas for the Lyapunov spectrum.

"  The Hamilton-Jacobi formalism generalized to 2-dimensional field theories according to Lepage's canonical framework is applied to several relativistic real scalar fields, e.g. massless and massive Klein-Gordon, Sinh and Sine-Gordon, Liouville and $\phi^4$ theories. The relations between the Euler-Lagrange and the Hamilton-Jacobi equations are discussed in DeDonder and Weyl's and the corresponding wave fronts are calculated in Carath\'eodory's formulation. Unlike mechanics we have to impose certain integrability conditions on the velocity fields to guarantee the transversality relations and especially the dynamical equivalence between Hamilton-Jacobi wave fronts and families of extremals embedded therein. B\""acklund Transformations play a crucial role in solving the resulting system of coupled nonlinear PDEs.

"  This paper surveys a range of methods to collect necessary performance data on Intel CPUs and NVIDIA GPUs for hierarchical Roofline analysis. As of mid-2020, two vendor performance tools, Intel Advisor and NVIDIA Nsight Compute, have integrated Roofline analysis into their supported feature set.

"  The thesis is divided into three parts. In the first part a new theoretical analysis of interferometric experiments by Alley-Shih, Ou-Mandel and the entanglement swapping experiment is performed. It is shown that the double- and single-photon distinguishability is not necessary for the experiments to be genuine tests against local realism. In the second part, basing on simple geometrical properties of Hilbert space, new, stronger Bell inequalities for M qubits in a maximally entangled state are derived. Application of the same method to two maximally entangled qubits yields an inequality for all possible positions of the local measuring apparatus. Finally, the series of the Greenberger-Horne- Zeilinger paradoxes for M maximally entangled quNits observed via symmetric unbiased 2N ports is derived. The last part of the thesis is devoted to the numerical approach to the Bell theorem. The necessary and sufficient conditions for the violation of local realism in the case of two and three maximally entangled qubits, on which each observer performs up to 10 (two qubits) and up to 5 (three qubits) local measurements, are shown. It is also numerically shown that in the case of two maximally entangled quNits (3 < N < 9) a properly defined magnitude of violation increases with N. In both cases the approach neither involves any simplifications, or additional assumptions, nor does it utilise any symmetries of the problem.

"  Style is an integral component of a sentence indicated by the choice of words a person makes. Different people have different ways of expressing themselves, however, they adjust their speaking and writing style to a social context, an audience, an interlocutor or the formality of an occasion. Text style transfer is defined as a task of adapting and/or changing the stylistic manner in which a sentence is written, while preserving the meaning of the original sentence.   A systematic review of text style transfer methodologies using deep learning is presented in this paper. We point out the technological advances in deep neural networks that have been the driving force behind current successes in the fields of natural language understanding and generation. The review is structured around two key stages in the text style transfer process, namely, representation learning and sentence generation in a new style. The discussion highlights the commonalities and differences between proposed solutions as well as challenges and opportunities that are expected to direct and foster further research in the field.

"  We perform a model independent analysis of the charged current $b\to cl\nu$ anomalies under the presence of scalar and vector interactions. The analysis is carried out in two stages: (a) under the presence of both (left-handed) vector and scalar interactions and (b) under the presence of scalar interactions alone. We find that even after stringent bounds from similar quark-level processes such as $B_c\to\tau\nu$, such scenarios have the potential to explain the aforementioned anomalies. Contrary to the general notion, we show that even scalar interactions alone can explain such anomalies, provided they are complex. However, extended scalar sector models are unable to comply with these anomalies to $\sim 3\sigma$. We further illustrate our results with the help of three benchmark models corresponding to the presence of (i) both scalar and vector (ii) real scalar and (iii) complex scalar interactions.

"  This paper reviews some of the key enabling technologies for advanced and future laser interferometer gravitational wave detectors, which must combine test masses with the lowest possible optical and acoustic losses, with high stability lasers and various techniques for suppressing noise. Sect. 1 of this paper presents a review of the acoustic properties of test masses. Sect. 2 reviews the technology of the amorphous dielectric coatings which are currently universally used for the mirrors in advanced laser interferometers, but for which lower acoustic loss would be very advantageous. In sect. 3 a new generation of crystalline optical coatings that offer a substantial reduction in thermal noise is reviewed. The optical properties of test masses are reviewed in sect. 4, with special focus on the properties of silicon, an important candidate material for future detectors.

"  When we elastically impose a homogeneous, affine deformation on amorphous solids, they also undergo an inhomogeneous, non-affine deformation, which can have a crucial impact on the overall elastic response. To correctly understand the elastic modulus $M$, it is therefore necessary to take into account not only the affine modulus $M_A$, but also the non-affine modulus $M_N$ that arises from the non-affine deformation. In the present work, we study the bulk ($M=K$) and shear ($M=G$) moduli in static jammed particulate packings over a range of packing fractions $\varphi$. One novelty of this work is to elucidate the contribution of each vibrational mode to the non-affine $M_N$ through a modal decomposition of the displacement and force fields. In the vicinity of the (un)jamming transition, $\varphi_{c}$, the vibrational density of states, $g(\omega)$, shows a plateau in the intermediate frequency regime above a characteristic frequency $\omega^\ast$. We illustrate that this unusual feature apparent in $g(\omega)$ is reflected in the behavior of $M_N$: As $\varphi \rightarrow \varphi_c$, where $\omega^\ast \rightarrow 0$, those modes for $\omega < \omega^\ast$ contribute less and less, while contributions from those for $\omega > \omega^\ast$ approach a constant value which results in $M_N$ to approach a critical value $M_{Nc}$, as $M_N-M_{Nc} \sim \omega^\ast$. At $\varphi_c$ itself, the bulk modulus attains a finite value $K_c=K_{Ac}-K_{Nc} > 0$, such that $K_{Nc}$ has a value that remains below $K_{Ac}$. In contrast, for the critical shear modulus $G_c$, $G_{Nc}$ and $G_{Ac}$ approach the same value so that the total value becomes exactly zero, $G_c = G_{Ac}-G_{Nc} =0$. We explore what features of the configurational and vibrational properties cause such the distinction between $K$ and $G$, allowing us to validate analytical expressions for their critical values.

"  The existence of a strong spectral gap for lattices in semi-simple Lie groups is crucial in many applications. In particular, for arithmetic lattices it is useful to have bounds for the strong spectral gap that are uniform in the family of congruence covers. When the lattice is itself a congruence group, there are uniform and very good bounds for the spectral gap coming from the known bounds toward the Ramanujan-Selberg conjectures. In this note, we establish a uniform bound for the strong spectral gap for congruence covers of an irreducible co-compact lattice $\Gamma$ in $PSL(2,R)^d$ with $d\geq 2$, which is the simplest and most basic case where the congruence subgroup property is not known.

"  The ""ALFA Ultra Deep Survey"" (AUDS) is an ongoing 21-cm spectral survey with the Arecibo 305m telescope. AUDS will be the most sensitive blind survey undertaken with Arecibo's 300 MHz Mock spectrometer. The survey searches for 21-cm HI line emission at redshifts between 0 and 0.16. The main goals of the survey are to investigate the HI content and probe the evolution of HI gas within that redshift region. In this paper, we report on a set of precursor observations with a total integration time of 53 hours. The survey detected a total of eighteen 21-cm emission lines at redshifts between 0.07 and 0.15 in a region centered around ra~0:00h, dec= 15:42deg. The rate of detection is consistent with the one expected from the local HI mass function. The derived relative HI density at the median redshift of the survey is rho_HI[z=0.125]=(1.0+/-0.3)*rho_0, where rho_0 is the HI density at zero redshift.

"  We propose a model that emulates saccades, the rapid movements of the eye, called the Error Saccade Model, based on the prediction error of the Predictive Vision Model (PVM). The Error Saccade Model carries out movements of the model's field of view to regions with the highest prediction error. Comparisons of the Error Saccade Model on Predictive Vision Models with and without a fovea show that a fovea-like structure in the input level of the PVM improves the Error Saccade Model's ability to pursue detailed objects in its view. We hypothesize that the improvement is due to poorer resolution in the periphery causing higher prediction error when an object passes, triggering a saccade to the next location.

"  In recent years there has been a surge of interest in what has come to be known as the `universal relations' between various global properties of neutron stars. These universal relations are equation of state independent relations between quantities such as the moment of inertia $I$, the tidal deformability or Love number $\lambda$, and the quadrupole $Q$ (I-Love-Q relations), or the relativistic multipole moments (3-hair relations). While I-Love-Q relations have been studied extensively in both general relativity and various alternatives, 3-hair relations have been studied only in general relativity. Recent progress on the definition of the multipole moments of a compact object in the case of scalar-tensor theories allows for the study of 3-hair relations in modified theories of gravity. Specifically, the aim of this work is to study them for scalarized stars in scalar-tensor theories with a massless scalar field that admit spontaneous scalarization. We find that the 3-hair relations between the mass and angular momentum moments that hold in general relativity hold for scalarized stars as well. The scalar moments also exhibit a universal behaviour, which is equation of state independent within one specific theory, but differs between different theories. Combining astrophysical observations one can in principle measure the different properties of scalarized neutron star and tell different theories apart.

"  In a previous paper [Phys. Rev. Lett. 91, 014501 (2003)], the mechanism of ""revolving rivers"" for sandpile formation is reported: as a steady stream of dry sand is poured onto a horizontal surface, a pile forms which has a river of sand on one side owing from the apex of the pile to the edge of the base. For small piles the river is steady, or continuous. For larger piles, it becomes intermittent. In this paper we establish experimentally the ""dynamical phase diagram"" of the continuous and intermittent regimes, and give further details of the piles topography, improving the previous kinematic model to describe it and shedding further light on the mechanisms of river formation. Based on experiments in Hele-Shaw cells, we also propose that a simple dimensionality reduction argument can explain the transition between the continuous and intermittent dynamics.

"  The computation of the dimension of linear systems of plane curves through a bunch of given multiple points is one of the most classic issues in Algebraic Geometry. In general, it is still an open problem to understand when the points fail to impose independent conditions. Despite many partial results, a complete solution is not known, even if the fixed points are in general position. The answer in the case of general points in the projective plane is predicted by the famous Segre-Harbourne-Gimigliano-Hirschowitz conjecture.   When we consider fixed points in special position, even more interesting situations may occur. Recently Di Gennaro, Ilardi and Vall\`{e}s discovered a special configuration $Z$ of nine points with a remarkable property: a general triple point always fails to impose independent conditions on the ideal of $Z$ in degree four. The peculiar structure and properties of this kind of \textit{unexpected curves} were studied by Cook II, Harbourne, Migliore and Nagel.   By using both explicit geometric constructions and more abstract algebraic arguments, we classify low degree unexpected curves. In particular, we prove that the aforementioned configuration $Z$ is the unique one giving rise to an unexpected quartic. ",On the unique unexpected quartic in $\mathbb{P}^2$
"  Genetic association studies, in particular the genome-wide association study design, have provided a wealth of novel insights into the aetiology of a wide range of human diseases and traits. The next challenge consists of understanding the molecular basis of these associations. The integration of multiple association datasets, including gene expression datasets, can contribute to this goal. We have developed a novel statistical methodology to assess whether two association signals are consistent with a shared causal variant. An application is the integration of disease scans with expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies, but any pair of GWAS datasets can be integrated in this framework. We demonstrate the value of the approach by reanalysing a gene expression dataset in 966 liver samples with a published meta-analysis of lipid traits including >100, 000 individuals of European ancestry. Combining all lipid biomarkers, our reanalysis supported 29 out of 38 reported colocalisation results with eQTLs and identified 14 new colocalisation results, highlighting the value of a formal statistical test. In two cases of reported eQTL-lipid pairs (IFT172, TBKBP1) for which our analysis suggests that the eQTL pattern is not consistent with the lipid association, we identify alternative colocalisation results with GCKR and KPNB1, indicating that these genes are more likely to be causal in these genomic intervals. A key feature of the method is the ability to derive the output statistics from single SNP summary statistics, hence making it possible to perform systematic meta-analysis type comparisons across multiple GWAS datasets (http://coloc.cs.ucl.ac.uk/coloc/). Our methodology provides information about candidate causal genes in associated intervals and has direct implications for the understanding of complex diseases and the design of drugs to target disease pathways.

"  Zinc oxide (ZnO) films having various thicknesses were synthesized on sapphire substrates by thermal oxidation of Zn-metallic films in air ambient. X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra indicate that the resulting films possess a polycrystalline hexagonal wurtzite structure without preferred orientation. For films having a thickness of 200 nm, crystal grain size was observed to decrease with increasing annealing temperature up to 600C, and then increase at higher temperatures. Thicker films demonstrated a modest increase in grain size as temperature increased from 300C to 1200C. The influence of film thickness on the optical properties was investigated using room temperature photoluminescence (PL). Specifically, PL spectra indicate four emission bands: excitonic ultraviolet, blue, and deep-level green and yellow emission. The strongest UV emission and narrowest full width at half maximum (0.09 eV) was observed for films having a thickness of 200 nm and annealed at low temperature (300C). The ratio of deep-level green emission to UV excitonic emission was observed to decrease with decreasing annealing temperature, which is attributed to the generation of fewer oxygen vacancies and interstitial oxygen ions in the bulk. As film thickness decreased, we observed the emergence of blue emission and a significant red shift (0.15 eV) in the bandgap. The emergence of blue emission and the corresponding decrease in emission associated with bulk defects when depletion width grows relative to the bulk suggests that the origin of the blue emission is related to the negatively charged Zinc interstitials found within the deletion region near the interface.

"  A large-S approach to the description of chiral phases in frustrated antiferromagnetic spin-S chains with easy-plane anisotropy is proposed. The approach is valid in the vicinity of the classical Lifshitz point j=1/4, where j is the relative strength of the frustrating next-nearest-neighbor coupling. The effective theory turns out to be the nonlinear sigma-model with the additional fourth-order term in spatial derivatives. The topological term persists for j>1/4, which leads to disappearance of the chiral gapped phase for half-integer S, in accordance with the recent numerical results.

  The Universe is modeled as a binary mixture whose constituents are described by a van der Waals fluid and by a dark energy density. The dark energy density is considered either as the quintessence or as the Chaplygin gas. The irreversible processes concerning the energy transfer between the van der Waals fluid and the gravitational field are taken into account. This model can simulate: (a) an inflationary period where the acceleration grows exponentially and the van der Waals fluid behaves like an inflaton; (b) an inflationary period where the acceleration is positive but it decreases and tends to zero whereas the energy density of the van der Waals fluid decays; (c) a decelerated period which corresponds to a matter dominated period with a non-negative pressure; and (d) a present accelerated period where the dark energy density outweighs the energy density of the van der Waals fluid. ,Cosmological models described by a mixture of van der Waals fluid and   dark energy
"  In spite of all advantages of solar energy, its deployment will significantly change the typical electric load profile, thus necessitating a change in traditional distribution grid management practices. In particular, the net load ramping, created as a result of simultaneous solar generation drop and load increase at early evening hours, is one of the major operational issues that needs to be carefully addressed. In this paper, microgrids are utilized to offer a viable and localized solution to this challenge while removing the need for costly investments by the electric utility. In this regard, first the microgrid ramping capability is determined via a min-max optimization, and second, the microgrid optimal scheduling model is developed to coordinate the microgrid net load with the distribution grid net load for addressing the ramping issue. Numerical simulations on a test distribution feeder with one microgrid exhibit the effectiveness of the proposed model.

"  The dynamics of electrons in the presence of a positive ion is considered for conditions of weak electron-electron couping but strong electron-ion coupling. The equilibrium electron density and electric field time correlation functions are evaluated for semi-classical conditions using a classical statistical mechanics with a regularized electron-ion interaction for MD simulation. The theoretical analysis for the equilibrium state is obtained from the corresponding nonlinear Vlasov equation. Time correlation functions for the electrons are determined from the linearized Vlasov equation. The resulting electron dynamics is described in terms of a distribution of single electron-ion trajectories screened by an inhomogeneous electron gas dielectric function. The results are applied to calculation of the autocorrelation function for the electron electric field at the ion for $ 0\leq Z\leq 40$, including conditions of strong electron-ion coupling. The electron stopping power and self-diffusion coefficient are determined from these results, and all properties calculated are compared with those obtained from semi-classical molecular dynamics simulation. The agreement with semi-classical MD simulation is found to be reasonable. The theoretical description provides an instructive interpretation for the strong electron-ion results.

"  The effect of short-range disorder in nodal line semimetals is studied by numerically exact means. For arbitrary small disorder, a novel semimetallic phase is unveiled for which the momentum-space amplitude of the ground-state wave function is concentrated around the nodal line and follows a multifractal distribution. At a critical disorder strength, a semimetal to compressible metal transition occurs, coinciding with a multi- to single-fractality transition. The universality class of this critical point is characterized by the correlation length and dynamical exponents. At considerably higher disorder, an Anderson metal-insulator transition takes place. Our results show that the nature of the semimetallic phase in non-clean samples is fundamentally different from a clean nodal semimetal.

"  We provide simple and accurate analytic approximations for the low frequency double Compton emission coefficient that are applicable in a broad range of physical situations up to mildly relativistic temperatures. These approximations may be useful for checking in which circumstances the double Compton process is important. We perform series expansions of the double Compton emission integral for low energies of the incident photon and electron and compare the derived analytic expressions with the results obtained by numerical integrations of the full double Compton cross section. We explicitly derived analytic approximations to the low frequency double Compton emission coefficient for initial monochromatic photons and Wien spectra. We show that combining the analytic approximations given in this paper, an accuracy of better than 5% over a very broad range of temperatures and under various physical conditions can be achieved. The double Compton emissivity strongly depends on the ratio of the incoming photon and electron energies: for hard photons and cold electrons the emission is strongly suppressed compared to the case of similar photon and electron energy, whereas in the opposite situation, i.e. hot electrons and soft initial photons, the emission is enhanced. For photons and electrons close to thermodynamic equilibrium the double Compton emissivity increases less rapidly with temperature than in the Lightman-Thorne approximation and the corrections exceed ~10% for temperatures above 4 keV.

"  Semantic memory is the subsystem of human memory that stores knowledge of concepts or meanings, as opposed to life specific experiences. The organization of concepts within semantic memory can be understood as a semantic network, where the concepts (nodes) are associated (linked) to others depending on perceptions, similarities, etc. Lexical access is the complementary part of this system and allows the retrieval of such organized knowledge. While conceptual information is stored under certain underlying organization (and thus gives rise to a specific topology), it is crucial to have an accurate access to any of the information units, e.g. the concepts, for efficiently retrieving semantic information for real-time needings. An example of an information retrieval process occurs in verbal fluency tasks, and it is known to involve two different mechanisms: -clustering-, or generating words within a subcategory, and, when a subcategory is exhausted, -switching- to a new subcategory. We extended this approach to random-walking on a network (clustering) in combination to jumping (switching) to any node with certain probability and derived its analytical expression based on Markov chains. Results show that this dual mechanism contributes to optimize the exploration of different network models in terms of the mean first passage time. Additionally, this cognitive inspired dual mechanism opens a new framework to better understand and evaluate exploration, propagation and transport phenomena in other complex systems where switching-like phenomena are feasible.

"  The Galactic microquasar GRS 1915+105 shows rich variability which is categorized into different classes. In this paper, we report temporal and spectral analysis of GRS 1915+105 to study the properties of the accretion flow when the light curve is showing $\theta$ class variability. For this purpose, we use the LAXPC data from the Target of Opportunity observations of India's first multi-wavelength astronomy satellite AstroSat. The $\theta$ class is marked by the recurrent appearance of U-shaped regions in the light curve, where the photon count rate first decreases rapidly and then increases slowly. For our analysis, we use U-shaped regions of first two orbits (02345 and 02346) on 2016 March 04. In both of the cases, the dynamic Power Density Spectra (PDS) showed significant power at around $4-5$ Hz, suggesting the presence of a low-frequency Quasi-Periodic Oscillation (QPO) around that frequency interval. The QPO frequency is found to increase with time when the enhancement of the energy flux also takes place. From the evolution of the spectra, we determine the evolution of the accretion flow parameters in both of these observations. Fitting the spectra with the transonic flow solution based Two-Component Advective Flow (TCAF) model in $4-25$ keV energy band shows that the Keplerian disk accretion rate rises with the rise in the radiation intensity, while the location of the centrifugal pressure driven shock front decreases. In both these data, a gradual increment of power-law photon index with intensity is observed suggesting the progressive softening of the source.

"  The possibility of achieving highly selective excitation of low metastable states of hydrogen and helium atoms by using short laser pulses with reasonable parameters is demonstrated theoretically. Interactions of atoms with the laser field are studied by solving the close-coupling equations without discretization. The parameters of laser pulses are calculated using different kinds of optimization procedures. For the excitation durations of hundreds of femtoseconds direct optimization of the parameters of one and two laser pulses with Gaussian envelopes is used to introduce a number of simple schemes of selective excitation. To treat the case of shorter excitation durations, optimal control theory is used and the calculated optimal fields are approximated by sequences of pulses with reasonable shapes. A new way to achieve selective excitation of metastable atomic states by using sequences of attosecond pulses is introduced.

"  An algorithm is presented for generating finite modular, semimodular, graded, and geometric lattices up to isomorphism. Isomorphic copies are avoided using a combination of the general-purpose graph-isomorphism tool nauty and some optimizations that handle simple cases directly. For modular and semimodular lattices, the algorithm prunes the search tree much earlier than the method of Jipsen and Lawless, leading to a speedup of several orders of magnitude. With this new algorithm modular lattices are counted up to 30 elements, semimodular lattices up to 25 elements, graded lattices up to 21 elements, and geometric lattices up to 34 elements. Some statistics are also provided on the typical shape of small lattices of these types. ",Generating modular lattices of up to 30 elements

We show that with this modern optimization technique it is possible to reliably assess the parameters of the resonances and the associated error bars as well as to identify weaknesses in the models. To illustrate the problems the optimization process may encounter, we provide results obtained for the nucleon resonances $\Delta$(1230) and $\Delta$(1700). The former can be easily isolated and thus has been studied in depth, while the latter is not as well known experimentally. ",Properties of Nucleon Resonances by means of a Genetic Algorithm
"  We report the first results of a spectroscopic survey of galaxies in the core of the Shapley Concentration, the richest nearby supercluster of clusters of galaxies. We have measured 311 new galaxy redshifts in an area of $\sim 4.5$ square degrees centered around the Abell cluster A3558. Considering also the data already available in the literature, the total number of galaxy redshifts in this area amounts to more than 500. On the basis of these data we estimate the mean velocities and the velocity dispersions of the Abell clusters A3556, A3558 and the poor cluster SC 1329 -314. Finally, from an analysis of the projected and three--dimensional distributions of galaxies in this region, we estimate the galaxy overdensity and find that the core of the Shapley Concentration has an interesting, very complex dynamical state: the main clusters appear to be interacting with each other, forming a single elongated structure containing many subcondensations.

"  The optics of a number of future X-ray telescopes will have very long focal lengths (10 - 20 m), and will consist of a number of nested/stacked thin, grazing-incidence mirrors. The optical quality characterization of a real mirror can be obtained via profile metrology, and the Point Spread Function of the mirror can be derived via one of the standard computation methods. However, in practical cases it can be difficult to access the optical surfaces of densely stacked mirror shells, after they have been assembled, using the widespread metrological tools. For this reason, the assessment of the imaging resolution of a system of mirrors is better obtained via a direct, full-illumination test in X-rays. If the focus cannot be reached, an intra-focus test can be performed, and the image can be compared with the simulation results based on the metrology, if available. However, until today no quantitative information was extracted from a full-illumination, intra-focal exposure. In this work we show that, if the detector is located at an optimal distance from the mirror, the intensity variations of the intra-focal, full-illumination image in single reflection can be used to reconstruct the profile of the mirror surface, without the need of a wavefront sensor. The Point Spread Function can be subsequently computed from the reconstructed mirror shape. We show the application of this method to an intra-focal (8 m distance from mirror) test performed at PANTER on an optical module prototype made of hot-slumped glass foils with a 20 m focal length, from which we could derive an expected imaging quality near 16 arcsec HEW.

"  We present a near-linear scaling formulation of the explicitly-correlated coupled-cluster singles and doubles with perturbative triples method (CCSD(T)$_{\overline{\text{F12}}}$) for high-spin states of open-shell species. The approach is based on the conventional open-shell CCSD formalism [M. Saitow et al., J. Chem. Phys. 146, 164105 (2017)] utilizing the domain local pair-natural orbitals (DLPNO) framework. The use of spin-independent set of pair-natural orbitals ensures exact agreement with the closed-shell formalism reported previously, with only marginally impact on the cost (e.g. the open-shell formalism is only 1.5 times slower than the closed-shell counterpart for the $\text{C}_\text{160}\text{H}_{\text{322}}$ n-alkane, with the measured size complexity of $\approx1.2$). Evaluation of coupled-cluster energies near the complete-basis-set (CBS) limit for open-shell systems with more than 550 atoms and 5000 basis functions is feasible on a single multi-core computer in less than 3 days. The aug-cc-pVTZ DLPNO-CCSD(T)$_{\overline{\text{F12}}}$ contribution to the heat of formation for the 50 largest molecules among the 348 core combustion species benchmark set [J. Klippenstein et al., J. Phys. Chem. A 121, 6580 (2017)] had root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) from the extrapolated CBS CCSD(T) reference values of 0.3 kcal/mol. For a more challenging set of 50 reactions involving small closed- and open-shell molecules [G. Knizia et al., J. Chem. Phys. 130, 054104 (2009)] the aug-cc-pVQ(+d)Z DLPNO-CCSD(T)$_{\overline{\text{F12}}}$ yielded a RMSD of $\sim$0.4 kcal/mol with respect to the CBS CCSD(T) estimate.

"  Assessment of learning in higher education is a critical concern to policy makers, educators, parents, and students. And, doing so appropriately is likely to require including constructed response tests in the assessment system. We examined whether scoring costs and other concerns with using open-end measures on a large scale (e.g., turnaround time and inter-reader consistency) could be addressed by machine grading the answers. Analyses with 1359 students from 14 colleges found that two human readers agreed highly with each other in the scores they assigned to the answers to three types of open-ended questions. These reader assigned scores also agreed highly with those assigned by a computer. The correlations of the machine-assigned scores with SAT scores, college grades, and other measures were comparable to the correlations of these variables with the hand-assigned scores. Machine scoring did not widen differences in mean scores between racial/ethnic or gender groups. Our findings demonstrated that machine scoring can facilitate the use of open-ended questions in large-scale testing programs by providing a fast, accurate, and economical way to grade responses.

"  Presence of noise in the labels of large scale facial expression datasets has been a key challenge towards Facial Expression Recognition (FER) in the wild. During early learning stage, deep networks fit on clean data. Then, eventually, they start overfitting on noisy labels due to their memorization ability, which limits FER performance. This work proposes an effective training strategy in the presence of noisy labels, called as Consensual Collaborative Training (CCT) framework. CCT co-trains three networks jointly using a convex combination of supervision loss and consistency loss, without making any assumption about the noise distribution. A dynamic transition mechanism is used to move from supervision loss in early learning to consistency loss for consensus of predictions among networks in the later stage. Inference is done using a single network based on a simple knowledge distillation scheme. Effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated on synthetic as well as real noisy FER datasets. In addition, a large test subset of around 5K images is annotated from the FEC dataset using crowd wisdom of 16 different annotators and reliable labels are inferred. CCT is also validated on it. State-of-the-art performance is reported on the benchmark FER datasets RAFDB (90.84%) FERPlus (89.99%) and AffectNet (66%). Our codes are available at https://github.com/1980x/CCT.

"  The morphological properties of galaxies between $21 {\rm~mag} < I < 25 {\rm~mag}$ in the {\em Hubble Deep Field} are investigated using a quantitative classification system based on measurements of the central concentration and asymmetry of galaxian light. The class distribution of objects in the {\em Hubble Deep Field} is strongly skewed towards highly asymmetric objects, relative to distributions from both the {\em HST Medium Deep Survey} at $I < 22 {\rm~mag}$ and an artificially redshifted sample of local galaxies. The steeply rising number count-magnitude relation for irregular/peculiar/merging systems at $I < 22 {~\rm mag}$ reported in Glazebrook \etal\ (1995a) continues to at least $I=25~{\rm mag}$. Although these peculiar systems are predominantly blue at optical wavelengths, a significant fraction also exhibit red $U-B$ colours, which may indicate they are at high redshift. Beyond Glazebrook \etal 's magnitude limit the spiral counts appear to rise more steeply than high-normalization no-evolution predictions, whereas those of elliptical/S0 galaxies only slightly exceed such predictions and may turn-over beyond $I \sim 24~{\rm mag}$. These results are compared with those from previous investigations of faint galaxy morphology with HST and the possible implications are briefly discussed. The large fraction of peculiar/irregular/merging systems in the {\em Hubble Deep Field} suggests that by $I\sim 25 {\rm~mag}$ the conventional Hubble system no longer provides an adequate description of the morphological characteristics of a high fraction of field galaxies.

"  The pair production rates for spin-zero and spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles are calculated on spaces of the form $M \times {\mathbb R}^{1,1}$ with $M$ corresponding to ${\mathbb R}^2$ (flat), $T^2$ (flat, compactified), $S^2$ (positive curvature) and $H^2$ (negative curvature), with and without a background magnetic field on $M$. The motivation is to elucidate the effects of curvature and background magnetic field. Contrasting effects for positive and negative curvature on the two cases of spin are obtained. For positive curvature, we find enhancement for spin-zero and suppression for spin-$\frac{1}{2}$, with the opposite effect for negative curvature.

"  In this paper a mean-field theory for the spin-liquid paramagnetic non-superconducting phase of the p- and n-type High-$T_c$ cuprates is developed. This theory applied to the effective $t-t'-t''-J^*$ model with the {\it ab initio} calculated parameters and with the three-site correlated hoppings. The static spin-spin and kinematic correlation functions beyond Hubbard-I approximation are calculated self-consistently. The evolution of the Fermi surface and band dispersion is obtained for the wide range of doping concentrations $x$. For p-type systems the three different types of behavior are found and the transitions between these types are accompanied by the changes in the Fermi surface topology. Thus a quantum phase transitions take place at $x=0.15$ and at $x=0.23$. Due to the different Fermi surface topology we found for n-type cuprates only one quantum critical concentration, $x=0.2$. The calculated doping dependence of the nodal Fermi velocity and the effective mass are in good agreement with the experimental data.

  A method of representation of a solution as segments of the series in powers of the step of the independent variable is expanded for solving complex systems of ordinary differential equations (ODE): the Lorenz system and other systems. A new procedure of reduction of the representation of the solution to a sum of two parts (regular and random) is performed. A shifting procedure is applied in each level of the independent variable to the random part and it acts as the filter that extracts the values to the regular part. In certain cases it is possible to omit the random part and construct the approximation which does not converge but still provides the qualitative information about the full solution (a linear approximation provides a simple exact solution). Evaluation of the error for this case is performed. Constructing the analytical representation of the solutions for these systems by the developed method is presented. ,Development of the method of computer analogy for studying and solving   complex nonlinear systems

"  We show how the resummation of large logarithms can be incorporated into the method of effective charges. As an example, we apply this approach to the event shape variables thrust and heavy jet mass in e+e- annihilation. We find that, although the resummation creates problems with the behaviour of the efective charge in the 2-jet limit, smaller power corrections are required to fit the data compared to the standard approach. In addition, increasing the logarithmic accuracy reduces the size of the power corrections further. We also consider ``predicting'' the sub-leading logarithms in the MSbar scheme, obtaining surprisingly good results for the first few NLL terms.

"  We propose computationally efficient methods for estimating stationary multivariate spatial and spatial-temporal spectra from incomplete gridded data.

In addition, we describe efficient methods for decomposing the estimated cross spectral density function into a linear model of coregionalization plus a residual process.

"  As a future plan, an advanced gravitational-wave detector will employ an optical configuration of resonant sideband extraction (RSE), achieved with an additional mirror at the signal-detection port of the power-recycled Fabry-Perot Michelson interferometer. To control the complex coupled cavity system, one of the most important design issues is how to extract the longitudinal control signals of the cavities. We developed a new signal-extraction scheme which provides an appropriate sensing matrix. The new method uses two sets of sidebands: one of the sideband components satisfies the critical coupling ondition for the RSE interferometer and reaches the signal-extraction port, and the other sideband is completely reflected by the Michelson interferometer. They provide a diagonalized sensing matrix and enable the RSE control to be robust. ",Development of signal-extraction scheme for Resonant Sideband Extraction
"  We propose an extensible deep learning method that uses reinforcement learning to train neural networks for offline ranking in information retrieval (IR). We call our method BanditRank as it treats ranking as a contextual bandit problem. In the domain of learning to rank for IR, current deep learning models are trained on objective functions different from the measures they are evaluated on. Since most evaluation measures are discrete quantities, they cannot be leveraged by directly using gradient descent algorithms without an approximation. BanditRank bridges this gap by directly optimizing a task-specific measure, such as mean average precision (MAP), using gradient descent. Specifically, a contextual bandit whose action is to rank input documents is trained using a policy gradient algorithm to directly maximize the reward. The reward can be a single measure, such as MAP, or a combination of several measures. The notion of ranking is also inherent in BanditRank, similar to the current \textit{listwise} approaches. To evaluate the effectiveness of BanditRank, we conducted a series of experiments on datasets related to three different tasks, i.e., web search, community, and factoid question answering. We found that it performs better than state-of-the-art methods when applied on the question answering datasets. On the web search dataset, we found that BanditRank performed better than four strong listwise baselines including LambdaMART, AdaRank, ListNet and Coordinate Ascent.

We find that significant electric currents in the simulation data call into question the use of the dual Ginzburg Landau Higgs model in interpreting the data. Further, two definitions of the penetration depth parameter take two different values. The splitting of this parameter into two is intricately connected to the existence of electric currents. It is important in our approach that we employ definitions of flux and electric and magnetic currents that respect Maxwell equations exactly for lattice averages independent of lattice spacings. Applied to specific Wilson loop sizes, our conclusions differ from those that use the dual GLH model.

"  The most active starbursts are found in galaxies with the highest IR luminosities, with peak star formation rates and efficiencies that are over an order of magnitude higher than in normal disk systems. These systems are almost exclusively on-going mergers. In this review I explore the conditions needed for interactions to experience such a phase by comparing two systems at similar stages of merging but quite different IR luminosities: NGC 4038/9 and Arp 299. These observations show that the most intense starbursts occur at the sites with the highest gas densities, which is a general result for IR luminous mergers. Observations and theory both suggest that the strength of the merger induced starburst depends on the internal structure of the progenitors, the amount and distribution of the gas, and the violence of the interaction. In particular, interactions involving progenitors with dense bulges, gas-rich disks, and/or a retrograde spin are expected to preferentially lead to large amounts of gaseous dissipation, although the interplay between these parameters is unknown. A major outstanding question is how the effects of feedback alter these conclusions. ","Mergers, Interactions, and The Fueling of Starbursts"

"  We investigate numerically the spin properties of electrons in flakes made of materials described by the Dirac equation, at the presence of intrinsic spin-orbit-coupling(SOC). We show that electrons flowing along the borders of flakes via edge states, become helically spin-polarized for strong SOC, for materials with and without a gap at the Fermi energy, corresponding to the massive and massless Dirac equation respectively. The helically spin-polarized electrons cause geometrical spin splitting on opposite sides of the flakes, leading to spin-resolved transport controlled by the flake's geometry in a multi-terminal device setup. A simple analytical model containing the basic ingredients of the problem is introduced to get an insight of the helical mechanism, along with our numerical results which are based on an effective tight-binding model.

"  Quantum repeater networks have attracted attention for the implementation of long-distance and large-scale sharing of quantum states. Recently, researchers extended classical network coding, which is a technique for throughput enhancement, into quantum information. The utility of quantum network coding (QNC) has been shown under ideal conditions, but it has not been studied previously under conditions of noise and shortage of quantum resources. We analyzed QNC on a butterfly network, which can create end-to-end Bell pairs at twice the rate of the standard quantum network repeater approach. The joint fidelity of creating two Bell pairs has a small penalty for QNC relative to entanglement swapping. It will thus be useful when we care more about throughput than fidelity. We found that the output fidelity drops below 0.5 when the initial Bell pairs have fidelity F < 0.90, even with perfect local gates. Local gate errors have a larger impact on quantum network coding than on entanglement swapping. ",Analysis of Quantum Network Coding for Realistic Repeater Networks

"  Quantum networks are distributed quantum many-body systems with tailored topology and controlled information exchange. They are the backbone of distributed quantum computing architectures and quantum communication. Here we present a prototype of such a quantum network based on single atoms embedded in optical cavities. We show that atom-cavity systems form universal nodes capable of sending, receiving, storing and releasing photonic quantum information. Quantum connectivity between nodes is achieved in the conceptually most fundamental way: by the coherent exchange of a single photon. We demonstrate the faithful transfer of an atomic quantum state and the creation of entanglement between two identical nodes in independent laboratories. The created nonlocal state is manipulated by local qubit rotation. This efficient cavity-based approach to quantum networking is particularly promising as it offers a clear perspective for scalability, thus paving the way towards large-scale quantum networks and their applications.

"  Second order Moeller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) at the complete basis set (CBS) limit and diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (DMC) are used to examine several low energy isomers of the water hexamer. Both approaches predict the so-called ""prism"" to be the lowest energy isomer, followed by ""cage"", ""book"", and ""cyclic"" isomers. The energies of the four isomers are very similar, all being within 10-15 meV/H2O. This reference data is then used to evaluate the performance of several density-functional theory (DFT) exchange-correlation (xc) functionals. A subset of the xc functionals tested for smaller water clusters [I: Santra et al., J. Chem. Phys. 127, 184104 (2007)] has been considered. Whilst certain functionals do a reasonable job at predicting the absolute dissociation energies of the various isomers (coming within 10-20 meV/H2O), none predict the correct energetic ordering of the four isomers, nor does any predict the correct low total energy isomer. All xc functionals tested either predict the book or cyclic isomers to have the largest dissociation energies. A many-body decomposition of the total interaction energies within the hexamers leads to the conclusion that the failure lies in the poor description of van der Waals (dispersion) forces in the xc functionals considered. It is shown that the addition of an empirical pairwise (attractive) C6/R6 correction to certain functionals allows for an improved energetic ordering of the hexamers. The relevance of these results to density-functional simulations of liquid water is also briefly discussed.

"  The oddness of a cubic graph is the smallest number of odd circuits in a 2-factor of the graph. This invariant is widely considered to be one of the most important measures of uncolourability of cubic graphs and as such has been repeatedly reoccurring in numerous investigations of problems and conjectures surrounding snarks (connected cubic graphs admitting no proper 3-edge-colouring). In [Ars Math. Contemp. 16 (2019), 277-298] we have proved that the smallest number of vertices of a snark with cyclic connectivity 4 and oddness 4 is 44. We now show that there are exactly 31 such snarks, all of them having girth 5. These snarks are built up from subgraphs of the Petersen graph and a small number of additional vertices. Depending on their structure they fall into six classes, each class giving rise to an infinite family of snarks with oddness at least 4 with increasing order. We explain the reasons why these snarks have oddness 4 and prove that the 31 snarks form the complete set of snarks with cyclic connectivity 4 and oddness 4 on 44 vertices. The proof is a combination of a purely theoretical approach with extensive computations performed by a computer. ",The smallest nontrivial snarks of oddness 4

"  The project concerns the interplay among quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics and thermodynamics, in isolated quantum systems. The underlying goal is to improve our understanding of the concept of thermal equilibrium in quantum systems. First, I investigated the role played by observables and measurements in the emergence of thermal behaviour. This led to a new notion of thermal equilibrium which is specific for a given observable, rather than for the whole state of the system. The equilibrium picture that emerges is a generalization of statistical mechanics in which we are not interested in the state of the system but only in the outcome of the measurement process. I investigated how this picture relates to one of the most promising approaches for the emergence of thermal behaviour in isolated quantum systems: the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis. Then, I applied the results to study some equilibrium properties of many-body localised systems. Despite the localization phenomenon, which prevents thermalization of subsystems, I was able to show that we can still use the predictions of statistical mechanics to describe the equilibrium of some observables. Moreover, the intuition developed in the process led me to propose an experimentally accessible way to unravel the interacting nature of many-body localised systems. Second, I exploited the ""Concentration of Measure"" phenomenon to study the macroscopic properties of the basis states of Loop Quantum Gravity. These techniques were previously used to explain why the thermal behaviour in quantum systems is such an ubiquitous phenomenon, at the macroscopic scale. I focused on the local properties, their thermodynamic behaviour and interplay with the semiclassical limit. This was motivated by the necessity to understand, from a quantum gravity perspective, how and why a classical horizon exhibits thermal properties.

"  Calculations of formation energies and charge transition levels of defects routinely rely on density functional theory (DFT) for describing the electronic structure. Since bulk band gaps of semiconductors and insulators are not well described in semilocal approximations to DFT, band-gap correction schemes or advanced theoretical models which properly describe band gaps need to be employed. However, it has become apparent that different methods that reproduce the experimental band gap can yield substantially different results regarding charge transition levels of point defects. We investigate this problem in the case of the (+2/0) charge transition level of the O vacancy in ZnO, which has attracted considerable attention as a benchmark case. For this purpose, we first perform calculations based on non-screened hybrid density functionals, and then compare our results with those of other methods. While our results agree very well with those obtained with screened hybrid functionals, they are strikingly different compared to those obtained with other band-gap corrected schemes. Nevertheless, we show that all the different methods agree well with each other and with our calculations when a suitable alignment procedure is adopted. The proposed procedure consists in aligning the electron band structure through an external potential, such as the vacuum level. When the electron densities are well reproduced, this procedure is equivalent to an alignment through the average electrostatic potential in a calculation subject to periodic boundary conditions. We stress that, in order to give accurate defect levels, a theoretical scheme is required to yield not only band gaps in agreement with experiment, but also band edges correctly positioned with respect to such a reference potential.

"  Theory of magneto-oscillation phenomena has been developed for two-dimensional electron systems with linear-in-k spin splitting. Both Dresselhaus and Rashba contributions are taken into account. It has been shown that the pattern of the magneto-oscillations depends drastically on the ratio between the above terms. The presence of only one type of the k-linear terms gives rise to the beats, i.e. two close harmonics corresponding to the spin-split subbands. However, if the strengths of both contributions are comparable, the third (central) harmonics appears in the spectrum of the magneto-oscillations. For equal strengths of the contributions, only the central harmonic survives, and the oscillations occur at a single frequency, although the k-linear terms remain in the Hamiltonian. Such suppression of the spin beats is studied in detail by the example of the Shubnikov-de Haas effect. ",Suppression of spin beats in magneto-oscillation phenomena in   two-dimensional electron gas

"  The performance of endoreversible thermal machines operating at finite power constitutes one of the main challenges of nonequilibrium classical and quantum thermodynamics, engineering and others. We introduce the idea of adjusting the interaction time asymmetry in order to optimize the engine performance. We consider one of the simplest thermal machines, composed of a quantum dot interacting sequentially with two different reservoirs of heat and particles. Distinct optimization protocols are analyzed in the framework of stochastic thermodynamics. Results reveal that asymmetric interaction times play a fundamental role in enhancing the power output and that maximizations can provide an increase larger than 25\% the symmetric case. As an extra advantage, efficiencies at maximum power are slightly greater than the endoreversible Curzon-Ahlborn efficiency for a broad range of reservoir temperatures.

"  The large time behavior of entropy solution to the compressible Euler equations for polytropic gas (the pressure $p(\rho)=\kappa\rho^{\gamma}, \gamma>1$) with time dependent damping like $-\frac{1}{(1+t)^\lambda}\rho u$ ($0<\lambda<1$) is investigated. By introducing an elaborate iterative method and using the intensive entropy analysis, it is proved that the $L^\infty$ entropy solution of compressible Euler equations with finite initial mass converges strongly in the natural $L^1$ topology to a fundamental solution of porous media equation (PME) with time-dependent diffusion, called by generalized Barenblatt solution. It is interesting that the $L^1$ decay rate is getting faster and faster as $\lambda$ increases in $(0, \frac{\gamma}{\gamma+2}]$, while is getting slower and slower in $[ \frac{\gamma}{\gamma+2}, 1)$.

"  We address the possibility that intelligent civilisations that destroy themselves could present signatures observable by humanity. Placing limits on the number of self-destroyed civilisations in the Milky Way has strong implications for the final three terms in Drake's Equation, and would allow us to identify which classes of solution to Fermi's Paradox fit with the evidence (or lack thereof).   Using the Earth as an example, we consider a variety of scenarios in which humans could extinguish their own technological civilisation. Each scenario presents some form of observable signature that could be probed by astronomical campaigns to detect and characterise extrasolar planetary systems. Some observables are unlikely to be detected at interstellar distances, but some scenarios are likely to produce significant changes in atmospheric composition that could be detected serendipitously with next-generation telescopes. In some cases, the timing of the observation would prove crucial to detection, as the decay of signatures is rapid compared to humanity's communication lifetime. In others, the signatures persist on far longer timescales. ",Observational Signatures of Self-Destructive Civilisations

  The electronic states of a finite-width graphene sheet in the presence of an electrostatic confining potential and a perpendicular magnetic field are investigated. The confining potential shifts the Landau levels inside the well and creates current-carrying states at or close to the interface with the barriers in addition to the edge states caused by the finite width of the sheet.

"  Electing democratic representatives via voting has been a common mechanism since the 17th century. However, these mechanisms raise concerns about fairness, privacy, vote concealment, fair calculations of tally, and proxies voting on their behalf for the voters. Ballot voting, and in recent times, electronic voting via electronic voting machines (EVMs) improves fairness by relying on centralized trust. Homomorphic encryption-based voting protocols also assure fairness but cannot scale to large scale elections such as presidential elections. In this paper, we leverage the blockchain technology of distributing trust to propose a smart contract-based protocol, namely, \proto. There are many existing protocols for voting using smart contracts. We observe that these either are not scalable or leak the vote tally during the voting stage, i.e., do not provide vote concealment. In contrast, we show that FASTEN preserves voter's privacy ensures vote concealment, immutability, and avoids double voting. We prove that the probability of privacy breaches is negligibly small. Further, our cost analysis of executing FASTEN over Ethereum is comparable to most of the existing cost of elections. ",FASTEN: Fair and Secure Distributed Voting Using Smart Contracts
"  We discuss how Starobinsky-like inflation may emerge from dilaton dynamics in brane cosmology scenarios based on string theory, in which our universe is represented as a three-brane. The effective potential may acquire a constant term from a density of effectively point-like non-pertubative defects on the brane. Higher-genus corrections generate corrections to the effective potential that are exponentially damped at large field values, as in the Starobinsky model, but at a faster rate, leading to a smaller prediction for the tensor-to scalar perturbation ratio r. This may be compensated partially by logarithmic deformations on the world-sheet due to recoil of the defects due to scattering by string matter on the brane, which tend to enhance the tensor-to-scalar ratio.

"  The thermoelectric effect in a quantum dot system connected to two electron reservoirs in the presence of a photon cavity is investigated using a quantum master equation in the steady-state regime. If a quantized photon field is applied to the quantum dot system, an extra channel, the photon replica states, are formed leading to a generation of a photon-induced thermoelectric current. We observe that the photon replica states contribute to the transport irrespective of the direction of the thermal gradient. In the off-resonance regime, when the photon energy is smaller than the energy difference between the lowest states of the quantum dot system, a current plateau is seen for strong electron-photon coupling. In the resonant regime, an inversion of thermoelectric current emerges due to the Rabi-splitting. Therefore, the photon field can change both the magnitude and the sign of the thermoelectric current induced by the temperature gradient in the absence of a voltage bias between the leads. ",Thermoelectric inversion in a resonant quantum dot-cavity system in the   steady-state regime
"  Recently, in order to address the unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) problem, extensive studies have been proposed to achieve transferrable models. Among them, the most prevalent method is adversarial domain adaptation, which can shorten the distance between the source domain and the target domain. Although adversarial learning is very effective, it still leads to the instability of the network and the drawbacks of confusing category information. In this paper, we propose a Robust Ensembling Network (REN) for UDA, which applies a robust time ensembling teacher network to learn global information for domain transfer. Specifically, REN mainly includes a teacher network and a student network, which performs standard domain adaptation training and updates weights of the teacher network. In addition, we also propose a dual-network conditional adversarial loss to improve the ability of the discriminator. Finally, for the purpose of improving the basic ability of the student network, we utilize the consistency constraint to balance the error between the student network and the teacher network. Extensive experimental results on several UDA datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of our model by comparing with other state-of-the-art UDA algorithms.

Such a feature also prevails in the situations in which deaf bands appear. We show that within the partial bandgaps, a stable imaging effect can be obtained for flat sonic crystal slabs, in analogy to the cases with photonic crystals.

"  Mean-field models approximate large stochastic systems by simpler differential equations that are supposed to approximate the mean of the larger system. It is generally assumed that as the stochastic systems get larger (i.e., more people or particles), they converge to the mean-field models. Mean-field models are common in many fields, but their convergence is rarely proved. The existing approaches rely on operator semigroups, martingales, PDEs, or infinite systems of ODEs. We give a general proof for their convergence using only Taylor's theorem and basic ODE results. We hope this allows applied researchers to routinely show convergence of their mean-field models, putting their work on a stronger foundation.

On the basis of these relationships, the rational approximants can be rewritten as a partial sum plus an appropriate transformation term. A Taylor expansion of such a transformation term, which is a rational function and which can be computed recursively, produces the predictions for those coefficients of the (formal) power series which were not used for the computation of the corresponding rational approximant.

"  We propose a new metaheuristic training scheme that combines Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Discrete Optimization in an unconventional way. Our idea is to define a discrete neighborhood of the current SGD point containing a number of ""potentially good moves"" that exploit gradient information, and to search this neighborhood by using a classical metaheuristic scheme borrowed from Discrete Optimization.   In the present paper we investigate the use of a simple Simulated Annealing (SA) metaheuristic that accepts/rejects a candidate new solution in the neighborhood with a probability that depends both on the new solution quality and on a parameter (the temperature) which is modified over time to lower the probability of accepting worsening moves. We use this scheme as an automatic way to perform hyper-parameter tuning, hence the title of the paper. A distinctive feature of our scheme is that hyper-parameters are modified within a single SGD execution (and not in an external loop, as customary) and evaluated on the fly on the current minibatch, i.e., their tuning is fully embedded within the SGD algorithm.   The use of SA for training is not new, but previous proposals were mainly intended for non-differentiable objective functions for which SGD is not applied due to the lack of gradients. On the contrary, our SA method requires differentiability of (a proxy of) the loss function, and leverages on the availability of a gradient direction to define local moves that have a large probability to improve the current solution.   Computational results on image classification (CIFAR-10) are reported, showing that the proposed approach leads to an improvement of the final validation accuracy for modern Deep Neural Networks such as ResNet34 and VGG16.

"  The Internet has revolutionized healthcare by offering medical information ubiquitously to patients via web search. The healthcare status, complex medical information needs of patients are expressed diversely and implicitly in their medical text queries. Aiming to better capture a focused picture of user's medical-related information search and shed insights on their healthcare information access strategies, it is challenging yet rewarding to detect structured user intentions from their diversely expressed medical text queries. We introduce a graph-based formulation to explore structured concept transitions for effective user intent detection in medical queries, where each node represents a medical concept mention and each directed edge indicates a medical concept transition. A deep model based on multi-task learning is introduced to extract structured semantic transitions from user queries, where the model extracts word-level medical concept mentions as well as sentence-level concept transitions collectively. A customized graph-based mutual transfer loss function is designed to impose explicit constraints and further exploit the contribution of mentioning a medical concept word to the implication of a semantic transition. We observe an 8% relative improvement in AUC and 23% relative reduction in coverage error by comparing the proposed model with the best baseline model for the concept transition inference task on real-world medical text queries.

"  Conditional density estimation generalizes regression by modeling a full density f(yjx) rather than only the expected value E(yjx). This is important for many tasks, including handling multi-modality and generating prediction intervals. Though fundamental and widely applicable, nonparametric conditional density estimators have received relatively little attention from statisticians and little or none from the machine learning community. None of that work has been applied to greater than bivariate data, presumably due to the computational difficulty of data-driven bandwidth selection. We describe the double kernel conditional density estimator and derive fast dual-tree-based algorithms for bandwidth selection using a maximum likelihood criterion. These techniques give speedups of up to 3.8 million in our experiments, and enable the first applications to previously intractable large multivariate datasets, including a redshift prediction problem from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.

"  (Abrigded) We report X-ray studies of the environs of SN 1998bw and GRB 980425 using the Chandra X-Ray Observatory 1281 days after the GRB. Combining our observation of the supernova with others of the GRB afterglow, a smooth X-ray light curve, spanning ~1300 days, is obtained by assuming the burst and supernova were coincident at 35.6 Mpc. When this X-ray light curve is compared with those of the X-ray ``afterglows'' of ordinary GRBs, X-ray Flashes, and ordinary supernovae, evidence emerges for at least two classes of lightcurves, perhaps bounding a continuum. By three to ten years, all these phenomena seem to converge on a common X-ray luminosity, possibly indicative of the supernova underlying them all. This convergence strengthens the conclusion that SN 1998bw and GRB 980425 took place in the same object. One possible explanation for the two classes is a (nearly) standard GRB observed at different angles, in which case X-ray afterglows with intermediate luminosities should eventually be discovered. Finally, we comment on the contribution of GRB afterglows to the ULX source population. ",Chandra Observations of the X-ray Environs of SN 1998bw/GRB 980425
"  Given a space X, we study the homotopy type of ${\mathcal B}_n(X)$ the space obtained as ""the union of all (n-1)-simplexes spanned by points in X"". This is a space encountered in non-linear analysis under the name of ""space of barycenters"" or in differential geometry in the case n=2 as the ""space of chords"". We first relate this space to a more familiar symmetric join construction and then determine its stable homotopy type in terms of the symmetric products on the suspension of X. This leads to a complete understanding of the homology of ${\mathcal B}_n(X)$ as a functor of X, and to an expression for its Euler characteristic given in terms of that of $X$. A sharp connectivity theorem is also established. Finally barycenter spaces of spheres are studied in details. ",Symmetric Joins and Weighted Barycenters
"  Two models for quasistatic adhesive unilateral contact delaminating in mixed fracture mode, i.e. distinguishing the less-dissipative Mode I (opening) from the more-dissipative Mode II (shearing), and allowing rigorous mathematical and numerical analysis, are studied. One model, referred to as Associative Plasticity-based Rate-Independent Model (APRIM), works for purely elastic bodies and involves, in addition to an interface damage variable, an auxiliary variable (representing interfacial plastic slip) to provide a fracture-mode sensitivity. It relies on a particular concept of force-driven local solutions (given by either vanishing-viscosity concept or maximum-dissipation principle). The other model, referred to as Linear Elastic - (perfectly) Brittle Interface Model (LEBIM), works visco-elastic bodies and rely on a conventional concept of weak solution and needs no auxiliary interfacial variable. This model is directly related to a usual phenomenological model of interface fracture by Hutchinson and Suo used in engineering. This paper devises a way how the phenomenology of the LEBIM can be fit to imitate the APRIM under relatively very slow loading, where both models are essentially rate-independent. The so-called effective dissipated energy is partitioned in both formulations to the surface energy and the energy dissipated during the interface debonding process, where the former is independent and the latter dependent on the fracture mode mixity. A numerical comparison of these models, implemented in a Boundary Element Method (BEM) code, is carried out on a suitable two-dimensional example. Furthermore, the computational efficiency and behaviour of the LEBIM is illustrated on another geometrically more complicated numerical example.

"  The aim of the present work is to investigate the performances of a specific Bayesian control chart used to compare two processes. The chart monitors the ratio of the percentiles of a key characteristic associated with the processes. The variability of such a characteristic is modeled via the Weibull distribution and a practical Bayesian approach to deal with Weibull data is adopted. The percentiles of the two monitored processes are assumed to be independent random variables. The Weibull distributions of the key characteristic of both processes are assumed to have the same and stable shape parameter. This is usually experienced in practice because the Weibull shape parameter is related to the main involved factor of variability. However, if a change of the shape parameters of the processes is suspected, the involved distributions can be used to monitor their stability. We first tested the effects of the number of the training data on the responsiveness of the chart. Then we tested the robustness of the chart in spite of very poor prior information. To this end, the prior values were changed to reflect a 50% shift in both directions from the original values of the shape parameter and the percentiles of the two monitored processes. Finally, various combinations of shifts were considered for the sampling distributions after the Phase I, with the purpose of estimating the diagnostic ability of the charts to signal an out-of-control state. The traditional approach based on the Average Run Length, empirically computed via a Monte Carlo simulation, was adopted.

"  Recent approaches to develop infrared photodetectors characterized by high sensitivities, broadband spectral coverage, easy integration with silicon electronics and low cost have been based on hybrid structures of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) and PbS colloidal quantum dots (CQDs). However, to date, such photodetectors have been reported with high sensitivity up to 1.5 $\mu$m.

To do this we studied two TMDC materials as a carrier transport layer, tungsten disulfide (WS$_2$) and molybdenum disulfide (MoS$_2$) and demonstrate that WS$_2$ based hybrid photodetectors outperform those of MoS$_2$ due to a more adequate band alignment that favors carrier transfer from the CQDs.

"  In this work, we develop a novel framework to measure the similarity between dynamic financial networks, i.e., time-varying financial networks. Particularly, we explore whether the proposed similarity measure can be employed to understand the structural evolution of the financial networks with time. For a set of time-varying financial networks with each vertex representing the individual time series of a different stock and each edge between a pair of time series representing the absolute value of their Pearson correlation, our start point is to compute the commute time matrix associated with the weighted adjacency matrix of the network structures, where each element of the matrix can be seen as the enhanced correlation value between pairwise stocks. For each network, we show how the commute time matrix allows us to identify a reliable set of dominant correlated time series as well as an associated dominant probability distribution of the stock belonging to this set. Furthermore, we represent each original network as a discrete dominant Shannon entropy time series computed from the dominant probability distribution. With the dominant entropy time series for each pair of financial networks to hand, we develop a similarity measure based on the classical dynamic time warping framework, for analyzing the financial time-varying networks. We show that the proposed similarity measure is positive definite and thus corresponds to a kernel measure on graphs. The proposed kernel bridges the gap between graph kernels and the classical dynamic time warping framework for multiple financial time series analysis. Experiments on time-varying networks extracted through New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) database demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

"  We analyse the spectra of the archival XMM-Newton data of the Seyfert 1 AGN Zw 229.015 in the energy range $0.3 - 10.0$ keV. When fitted with a simple power-law, the spectrum shows signatures of weak soft excess below 1.0 keV. We find that both thermal comptonisation and relativistically blurred reflection models provide the most acceptable spectral fits with plausible physical explanations to the origin of the soft excess than do multicolour disc blackbody and smeared wind absorption models. This motivated us to study the variability properties of the soft and the hard X-ray emissions from the source and the relationship between them to put further constraints on the above models. Our analysis reveals that the variation in the $3.0 - 10.0$ keV band lags that in the $0.3 - 1.0$ keV by $600^{+290}_{-280}$ s, while the lag between the $1.0 - 10.0$ keV and $0.3 - 1.0$ keV is $980^{+500}_{-500}$ s. This implies that the X-ray emissions are possibly emanating from different regions within the system. From these values, we estimate the X-ray emission region to be within $20R_g$ of the central supermassive black hole (where $R_g=GM/c^2$, $M$ is the mass of black hole, $G$ the Newton gravitational constant and $c$ the speed of light). Furthermore, we use XMM-Newton and Kepler photometric lightcurves of the source to search for possible nonlinear signature in the flux variability. We find evidence that the variability in the system may be dominated by stochasticity rather than deterministic chaos which has implications for the dynamics of the accretion system.

"  In this paper, we present a framework rooted in control and planning that enables quadrupedal robots to traverse challenging terrains with discrete footholds using visual feedback. Navigating discrete terrain is challenging for quadrupeds because the motion of the robot can be aperiodic, highly dynamic, and blind for the hind legs of the robot. Additionally, the robot needs to reason over both the feasible footholds as well as robot velocity by speeding up and slowing down at different parts of the terrain. We build an offline library of periodic gaits which span two trotting steps on the robot, and switch between different motion primitives to achieve aperiodic motions of different step lengths on an A1 robot. The motion library is used to provide targets to a geometric model predictive controller which controls stance. To incorporate visual feedback, we use terrain mapping tools to build a local height map of the terrain around the robot using RGB and depth cameras, and extract feasible foothold locations around both the front and hind legs of the robot. Our experiments show a Unitree A1 robot navigating multiple unknown, challenging and discrete terrains in the real world.

"  The structure and the evolution of Pulsar Wind Nebulae (PWNe) are studied by means of two-dimensional axisymmetric relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) simulations. After the first imaging of the Crab Nebula with Chandra, a growing number of objects has been found to show in the X-rays spatial features such as rings and jets, that clearly cannot be accounted for within the standard framework of one-dimensional semi-analytical models. The most promising explanation suggested so far is based on the combined effects of the latitude dependence of the pulsar wind energy flux, shaping the wind termination shock and naturally providing a higher equatorial emission, and of the wind magnetization, likely responsible for the jet collimation by hoop stresses downstream of the shock. This scenario is investigated here by following the evolution of a PWN interacting with the confining Supernova Remnant (SNR), from the free expansion to the beginning of the reverberation phase. Our results confirm the oblate shape of the wind termination shock and the formation of a polar jet with supersonic velocities (v~0.5-0.7 c) for high enough values of the equatorial wind magnetization parameter (sigma~0.01).

"  Analytic, first-principles performance modeling of distributed-memory parallel codes is notoriously imprecise. Even for applications with extremely regular and homogeneous compute-communicate phases, simply adding communication time to computation time does often not yield a satisfactory prediction of parallel runtime due to deviations from the expected simple lockstep pattern caused by system noise, variations in communication time, and inherent load imbalance. In this paper, we highlight the specific cases of provoked and spontaneous desynchronization of memory-bound, bulk-synchronous pure MPI and hybrid MPI+OpenMP programs. Using simple microbenchmarks we observe that although desynchronization can introduce increased waiting time per process, it does not necessarily cause lower resource utilization but can lead to an increase in available bandwidth per core. In case of significant communication overhead, even natural noise can shove the system into a state of automatic overlap of communication and computation, improving the overall time to solution. The saturation point, i.e., the number of processes per memory domain required to achieve full memory bandwidth, is pivotal in the dynamics of this process and the emerging stable wave pattern. We also demonstrate how hybrid MPI-OpenMP programming can prevent desirable desynchronization by eliminating the bandwidth bottleneck among processes. A Chebyshev filter diagonalization application is used to demonstrate some of the observed effects in a realistic setting.

"  We consider the classical instantonic contribution to the open string configuration associated with three D-branes with relative rotation matrices in SO(4) which corresponds to the computation of the classical part of the correlator of three non Abelian twist fields. We write the classical solution as a sum of a product of two hypergeometric functions. Differently from all the previous cases with three D-branes, the solution is not holomorphic and suggests that the classical bosonic string knows when the configuration may be supersymmetric. We show how this configuration reduces to the standard Abelian twist field computation. From the phenomenological point of view, the Yukawa couplings between chiral matter at the intersection in this configuration are more suppressed with respect to the factorized case in the literature.

"  We discuss the cosmological simulation code GADGET-2, a new massively parallel TreeSPH code, capable of following a collisionless fluid with the N-body method, and an ideal gas by means of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). Our implementation of SPH manifestly conserves energy and entropy in regions free of dissipation, while allowing for fully adaptive smoothing lengths. Gravitational forces are computed with a hierarchical multipole expansion, which can optionally be applied in the form of a TreePM algorithm, where only short-range forces are computed with the `tree'-method while long-range forces are determined with Fourier techniques. Time integration is based on a quasi-symplectic scheme where long-range and short-range forces can be integrated with different timesteps. Individual and adaptive short-range timesteps may also be employed. The domain decomposition used in the parallelisation algorithm is based on a space-filling curve, resulting in high flexibility and tree force errors that do not depend on the way the domains are cut. The code is efficient in terms of memory consumption and required communication bandwidth. It has been used to compute the first cosmological N-body simulation with more than 10^10 dark matter particles, reaching a homogeneous spatial dynamic range of 10^5 per dimension in a 3D box. It has also been used to carry out very large cosmological SPH simulations that account for radiative cooling and star formation, reaching total particle numbers of more than 250 million. We present the algorithms used by the code and discuss their accuracy and performance using a number of test problems. GADGET-2 is publicly released to the research community.

"  Aims. We present pyUPMASK, an unsupervised clustering method for stellar clusters that builds upon the original UPMASK package. Its general approach makes it plausible to be applied to analyses that deal with binary classes of any kind, as long as the fundamental hypotheses are met. The code is written entirely in Python and is made available through a public repository. Methods.The core of the algorithm follows the method developed in UPMASK but introducing several key enhancements. These enhancements not only make pyUPMASK more general, they also improve its performance considerably. Results. We thoroughly tested the performance of pyUPMASK on 600 synthetic clusters, affected by varying degrees of contamination by field stars. To assess the performance we employed six different statistical metrics that measure the accuracy of probabilistic classification. Conclusions. Our results show that pyUPMASK is better performant than UPMASK for every statistical performance metric, while still managing to be many times faster.

"  We present an analytical scheme for the design of realistic metagratings for wide-angle engineered reflection. These recently proposed planar structures can reflect an incident plane wave into a prescribed (generally non-specular) angle with very high efficiencies, using only a single meta-atom per period. Such devices offer a means to overcome the implementation difficulties associated with standard metasurfaces (consisting of closely-packed subwavelength meta-atoms) and the relatively low efficiencies of gradient metasurfaces. In contrast to previous work, in which accurate systematic design was limited to metagratings unrealistically suspended in free space, we derive herein a closed-form formalism allowing realization of printed-circuit-board (PCB) metagrating perfect reflectors, comprised of loaded conducting strips defined on standard metal-backed dielectric substrate. The derivation yields a detailed procedure for the determination of the substrate thickness and conductor geometry required to achieve unitary coupling efficiencies, without requiring even a single full-wave simulation. Our methodology, verified via commercial solvers, ultimately allows one to proceed from a theoretical design to synthesis of a full physical structure, avoiding the time-consuming numerical optimizations typically involved in standard metasurface design.

"  Using the Galactica code of Benson et al., we obtain quantitative measurements of spheroid-to-disk ratios for a sample of 8839 galaxies observed in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We carry out extensive tests of this code and of Gim2D, finding that they perform similarly in all respects. From the spheroid and disk luminosities, we construct luminosity and stellar mass functions for each component and estimate the relative luminosity and stellar mass densities of disks and spheroids in the local Universe. Assuming a simple one-to-one mapping between between spheroid mass and the mass of a central supermassive black hole, we provide the most accurate determination so far of the black hole mass function in the local universe. From this, we infer a cosmological mass density of black holes of rho_BH=3.77 +/- 0.97 x 10^5 h M_sun Mpc^-3. We compare our results to predictions from current hierarchical models of galaxy formation and these are found to fare well in predicting the qualitative trends observed. We find that stars in disks contribute 35-51% of the local stellar mass density.

"  We review certain classes of iterated integrals that appear in the computation of Feynman integrals that involve elliptic functions. These functions generalise the well-known class of multiple polylogarithms to elliptic curves and are closely related to the elliptic multiple polylogarithms (eMPLs) studied in the mathematics literature. When evaluated at certain special values of the arguments, eMPLs reduce to another class of special functions, defined as iterated integrals of Eisenstein series. As a novel application of our formalism, we illustrate how a class of special functions introduced by Remiddi and one of the authors can always naturally be expressed in terms of either eMPLs or iterated integrals of Eisenstein series for the congruence subgroup Gamma(6).

"  Quantum many-body scarring is believed to be the mechanism behind long-lived coherent oscillations in interacting Rydberg atom chains. These persistent oscillations are due to the large overlap of the many-body scars with certain initial states. We show that the ""effective dimension"" is a useful measure for identifying non-thermalising initial states in many-body scarred systems. By minimising the effective dimension we find physically reasonable initial states of the Rydberg chain that lead to more pronounced and longer lived oscillations, accentuating the effect of the many-body scars on the dynamics.

"  In cognitive radio mobile ad hoc networks (CR-MANETs), secondary users can cooperatively sense the spectrum to detect the presence of primary users. In this chapter, we propose a fully distributed and scalable cooperative spectrum sensing scheme based on recent advances in consensus algorithms. In the proposed scheme, the secondary users can maintain coordination based on only local information exchange without a centralized common receiver. We use the consensus of secondary users to make the final decision. The proposed scheme is essentially based on recent advances in consensus algorithms that have taken inspiration from complex natural phenomena including flocking of birds, schooling of fish, swarming of ants and honeybees. Unlike the existing cooperative spectrum sensing schemes, there is no need for a centralized receiver in the proposed schemes, which make them suitable in distributed CR-MANETs. Simulation results show that the proposed consensus schemes can have significant lower missing detection probabilities and false alarm probabilities in CR-MANETs. It is also demonstrated that the proposed scheme not only has proven sensitivity in detecting the primary user's presence, but also has robustness in choosing a desirable decision threshold.

"  We describe aspects of particle creation in strong fields using a quantum kinetic equation with a relaxation-time approximation to the collision term. The strong electric background field is determined by solving Maxwell's equation in tandem with the Vlasov equation. Plasma oscillations appear as a result of feedback between the background field and the field generated by the particles produced. The plasma frequency depends on the strength of the initial background field and the collision frequency, and is sensitive to the necessary momentum-dependence of dressed-parton masses.

"  We show how real-number codes can be used to compress correlated sources and establish a new framework for distributed lossy source coding, in which we quantize compressed sources instead of compressing quantized sources. This change in the order of binning and quantization blocks makes it possible to model correlation between continuous-valued sources more realistically and compensate for the quantization error when the sources are completely correlated. We focus on the asymmetric case, i.e., lossy source coding with side information at the decoder, also known as Wyner-Ziv coding. The encoding and decoding procedures are described in detail for discrete Fourier transform (DFT) codes, both for syndrome- and parity-based approaches. We also extend the parity-based approach to the case where the transmission channel is noisy and perform distributed joint source-channel coding in this context. The proposed system is well suited for low-delay communications. Furthermore, the mean-squared reconstruction error (MSE) is shown to be less than or close to the quantization error level, the ideal case in coding based on binary codes.

"  We propose experimental measurements of the logarithmic negativity, which quantifies quantum correlations using Gouy phase measurements in an asymmetric double-slit interference experiment for twin photons. This is possible because both quantities have analogous dependence with the spatial confinement by the slits and enables one to manipulate the portion of entanglement by the Gouy phase. In order to obtain those measurements, we need to work in a regime where the position correlations between particles are strong, therefore we investigate such correlations for biphotons. Since we would like to handle entanglement quantifiers through the Gouy phase, we analyze the Gouy phase difference for two entangled photons in an asymmetric double-slit interference experiment.

"  We analyze the high-temperature behavior of the susceptibilities towards a number of possible ordered states in the t-J-V model using the high-temperature series expansion. From all diagrams with up to ten edges, reliable results are obtained down to temperatures of order J, or (with some optimism) to J/2. In the unphysical regime, t<J, large superconducting susceptibilities are found, which moreover increase with decreasing temperatures, but for t>J, these susceptibilities are small and decreasing with decreasing temperature; this suggests that the t-J model does not support high-temperature superconductivity. We also find modest evidence of a tendency toward nematic and d-density wave orders.   ERRATUM: Due to an error in the calculation, the series for d-wave supeconducting and extended s-wave superconducting orders were incorrect. We recalculate the series and give the replacement figures. In agreement with our earlier findings, we still find no evidence of any strong enhancement of the superconducting susceptibility with decreasing temperature. However, because different Pade approximants diverge from each other at somewhat higher temperatures than we originally found, it is less clear what this implies concerning the presence or absence of high-temperature superconductivity in the t-J model.

"  In many areas of applied geometric/numeric computational mathematics, including geo-mapping, computer vision, computer graphics, finite element analysis, medical imaging, geometric design, and solid modeling, one has to compute incidences, adjacencies and ordering of cells, generally using disparate and often incompatible data structures and algorithms.

"  Rafts, or functional domains, are transient nano- or mesoscopic structures in the plasma membrane and are thought to be essential for many cellular processes such as signal transduction, adhesion, trafficking and lipid/protein sorting. Observations of these membrane heterogeneities have proven challenging, as they are thought to be both small and short-lived. With a combination of coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations and neutron diffraction using deuterium labeled cholesterol molecules we observe raft-like structures and determine the ordering of the cholesterol molecules in binary cholesterol-containing lipid membranes. From coarse-grained computer simulations, heterogenous membranes structures were observed and characterized as small, ordered domains. Neutron diffraction was used to study the lateral structure of the cholesterol molecules. We find pairs of strongly bound cholesterol molecules in the liquid-disordered phase, in accordance with the umbrella model. Bragg peaks corresponding to ordering of the cholesterol molecules in the raft-like structures were observed and indexed by two different structures: a monoclinic structure of ordered cholesterol pairs of alternating direction in equilibrium with cholesterol plaques, i.e., triclinic cholesterol bilayers.

  Optical conductivity of an interacting polaron gas is calculated within an extended random phase approximation which takes into account mixing of collective excitations of the electron gas with LO phonons. This mixing is important for the optical response of strongly polar crystals where the static dielectric constant is rather high: strontium titanate is the case. The present calculation sheds light on unexplained features of experimentally observed optical conductivity spectra in $n$-doped SrTiO$_{3}$. These features appear to be due to dynamic screening of the electron-electron interaction by polar optical phonons and hence do not require additional mechanisms for the explanation. ,Optical response of an interacting polaron gas in strongly polar   crystals
"  Graphical models are used to describe the conditional independence relations in multivariate data. They have been used for a variety of problems, including log-linear models (Liu and Massam, 2006), network analysis (Holland and Leinhardt, 1981; Strauss and Ikeda, 1990; Wasserman and Pattison, 1996; Pattison and Wasserman, 1999; Robins et al., 1999);, graphical Gaussian models (Roverato and Whittaker, 1998; Giudici and Green, 1999; Marrelec and Benali, 2006), and genetics (Dobra et al., 2004). A distribution that satisfies the conditional independence structure of a graph is Markov. A graphical model is a family of distributions that is restricted to be Markov with respect to a certain graph. In a Bayesian problem, one may specify a prior over the graphical model. Such a prior is called a hyper Markov law if the random marginals also satisfy the independence constraints. Previous work in this area includes (Dempster, 1972; Dawid and Lauritzen, 1993; Giudici and Green, 1999; Letac and Massam, 2007).

"  The anisotropic lattice fermion actions are investigated with the one-loop perturbative calculations aiming at constructing a formulation for heavy quark with controlled systematic uncertainties. For the heavy-light systems at rest the anisotropic lattice with small temporal lattice spacing $a_t$ suppresses the discretization error by a power of $a_t m_Q$ for a heavy quark of mass $m_Q$. We discuss the issue of large discretization errors, which scales as $a_s m_Q$ with $a_s$ the spatial lattice spacing. By performing one-loop calculations of the speed-of-light renormalization for several possible lattice actions in the limit of $a_t\to 0$, we show that one can eliminate the large systematic error on the anisotropic lattice.

"  Recent studies have illustrated that stochastic gradient Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques have a strong potential in non-convex optimization, where local and global convergence guarantees can be shown under certain conditions. By building up on this recent theory, in this study, we develop an asynchronous-parallel stochastic L-BFGS algorithm for non-convex optimization. The proposed algorithm is suitable for both distributed and shared-memory settings. We provide formal theoretical analysis and show that the proposed method achieves an ergodic convergence rate of ${\cal O}(1/\sqrt{N})$ ($N$ being the total number of iterations) and it can achieve a linear speedup under certain conditions. We perform several experiments on both synthetic and real datasets.

"  We investigate the pseudo-Casimir force acting between two charged surfaces confining a single polyelectrolyte chain with opposite charge. We expand the exact free energy to the second order in the local electrostatic field as well as the replicated polymer density field around the mean-field (saddle-point) solution. The quadratic terms lead to a fluctuation interaction that is partly due to the (thermal) Casimir effect for the confined electrostatic field and partly due to the pseudo-Casimir effect due to the confined replicated polymer density field. We study the intersurface separation dependence of both effects and show that the pseudo-Casimir effect leads to a long range attraction between the surfaces that decays with an anomalous algebraic exponent of $\sim 1.7$, smaller than the standard exponent of 2 in the case of Casimir interactions.

"  The determination of the galaxy luminosity function is an active and fundamental field in observational cosmology. In this paper we propose a cost effective way of measuring galaxy luminosity functions at faint magnitudes. Our technique employs the use of galaxy redshifts estimated from their multicolor photometry (Connolly et al. 1995). Associated with the redshift estimate is a well defined error distribution. We have derived a variant of Lynden-Bell's (1971) C--method that considers, for each galaxy, the probability distribution in absolute magnitude resultant from the redshift error. This technique is tested through simulations and potential biases are quantified. We then apply the technique to a sample of galaxies with multicolor photometric data at moderately faint (B=23) limits, and compare the results to a subset of these data with spectroscopic redshifts. We find that the luminosity function derived from the photometric redshifts is consistent with that determined from spectroscopic redshifts.

"  Understanding mixing and transport of passive scalars in active fluids is important to many natural (e.g. algal blooms) and industrial (e.g. biofuel, vaccine production) processes. Here, we study the mixing of a passive scalar (dye) in dilute suspensions of swimming Escherichia coli in experiments using a two-dimensional (2D) time-periodic flow and in a simple simulation. Results show that the presence of bacteria hinders large scale transport and reduce overall mixing rate. Stretching fields, calculated from experimentally measured velocity fields, show that bacterial activity attenuates fluid stretching and lowers flow chaoticity. Simulations suggest that this attenuation may be attributed to a transient accumulation of bacteria along regions of high stretching. Spatial power spectra and correlation functions of dye concentration fields show that the transport of scalar variance across scales is also hindered by bacterial activity, resulting in an increase in average size and lifetime of structures. On the other hand, at small scales, activity seems to enhance local mixing. One piece of evidence is that the probability distribution of the spatial concentration gradients is nearly symmetric with a vanishing skewness. Overall, our results show that the coupling between activity and flow can lead to nontrivial effects on mixing and transport.

"  The properties of the quark-gluon plasma(QGP) in the presence of baryon chemical potential are studied using the Field Correlator Method(FCM). At low densities the QGP thermodynamics with the colormagnetic confinement and the Polyakov line interaction is in good agreement with lattice data,and the speed of sound satisfies $C_s^2\leq \frac13$,but in the intermediate range of densities the speed of sound displays a singular behaviour and one needs density modifications of the Polyakov line interaction to avoid instabilities. In particular for $\mu_q >0.5$ GeV there exists a region in the $(\mu, T)$ plane where $C^2_s$ violates the conformal limit.

"  Local meshless methods using RBFs augmented with monomials have become increasingly popular, due to the fact that they can be used to solve PDEs on scattered node sets in a dimension-independent way, with the ability to easily control the order of the method, but at a greater cost to execution time. We analyze this ability on a Poisson problem with mixed boundary conditions in 1D, 2D and 3D, and reproduce theoretical convergence orders practically, also in a dimension-independent manner, as demonstrated with a solution of Poisson's equation in an irregular 4D domain.

"  To understand recent works on classical and quantum spin equations and their topological classification, we develop a unified mathematical framework for bosonic BdG systems and associated classical wave equations; it applies not just to equations that describe quantized spin excitations in magnonic crystals but more broadly to other systems that are described by a BdG hamiltonian. Because here the generator of dynamics, the analog of the hamiltonian, is para-, aka Krein-, hermitian but not hermitian, the theory of Krein spaces plays a crucial role. For systems which are thermodynamically stable, the classical equations can be expressed as a Schr\""odinger equation with a hermitian hamiltonian. We then proceed to apply the Cartan-Altland-Zirnbauer classification scheme: to properly understand what topological class these equations belong to, we need to conceptually distinguish between symmetries and constraints. Complex conjugation enters as a particle-hole constraint (as opposed to a symmetry), since classical waves are necessarily real-valued. Because of this distinction only commuting symmetries enter in the topological classification. Our arguments show that the equations for spin waves in magnonic crystals are a system of class A, the same topological class as quantum hamiltonians describing the Integer Quantum Hall Effect. Consequently, the magnonic edge modes first predicted by Shindou et al. are indeed analogs of the Quantum Hall Effect, and their net number is topologically protected.

"  Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) provides real-space electronic state information at the atomic scale that is most commonly used to study materials surfaces. An intriguing extension of the method is attempt to study the electronic structure at an insulator/conductor interface by performing low-bias imaging above the surface of an ultrathin insulating layer on the conducting substrate. We use first-principles theory to examine the physical mechanisms giving rise to the formation of low-bias STM images in the MgO/Ag system. We show that the main features of the low-bias STM contrast are completely determined by the atoms on the surface of MgO. Hence, the low-bias contrast is formed by states at the Fermi level in the Ag that propagate evanescently through the lattice and atomic orbitals of the MgO on their way to the surface. We develop a number of analysis techniques based on an ab initio tight-binding representation that allow identification of the origin of the STM contrast in cases where previous approaches have proven ambiguous.

"  An adversary who has obtained the cryptographic hash of a user's password can mount an offline attack to crack the password by comparing this hash value with the cryptographic hashes of likely password guesses. This offline attacker is limited only by the resources he is willing to invest to crack the password. Key-stretching tools can help mitigate the threat of offline attacks by making each password guess more expensive for the adversary to verify. However, key-stretching increases authentication costs for a legitimate authentication server. We introduce a novel Stackelberg game model which captures the essential elements of this interaction between a defender and an offline attacker. We then introduce Cost Asymmetric Secure Hash (CASH), a randomized key-stretching mechanism that minimizes the fraction of passwords that would be cracked by a rational offline attacker without increasing amortized authentication costs for the legitimate authentication server. CASH is motivated by the observation that the legitimate authentication server will typically run the authentication procedure to verify a correct password, while an offline adversary will typically use incorrect password guesses. By using randomization we can ensure that the amortized cost of running CASH to verify a correct password guess is significantly smaller than the cost of rejecting an incorrect password. Using our Stackelberg game framework we can quantify the quality of the underlying CASH running time distribution in terms of the fraction of passwords that a rational offline adversary would crack. We provide an efficient algorithm to compute high quality CASH distributions for the defender. Finally, we analyze CASH using empirical data from two large scale password frequency datasets. Our analysis shows that CASH can significantly reduce (up to $50\%$) the fraction of password cracked by a rational offline adversary.

"  Due to the complexity of Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), cost and effort estimation for SOA-based software development is more difficult than that for traditional software development. Unfortunately, there is a lack of published work about cost and effort estimation for SOA-based software. Existing cost estimation approaches are inadequate to address the complex service-oriented systems. This paper proposes a novel framework based on Divide-and-Conquer (D&C) for cost estimation for building SOA-based software. By dealing with separately development parts, the D&C framework can help organizations simplify and regulate SOA implementation cost estimation. Furthermore, both cost estimation modeling and software sizing work can be satisfied respectively by switching the corresponding metrics within this framework. Given the requirement of developing these metrics, this framework also defines the future research in four different directions according to the separate cost estimation sub-problems.

"  We report on the impact of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction on the coherent backscattering of spin waves in a disordered magnetic material. This interaction breaks the inversion symmetry of the spin-wave dispersion relation, such that $\omega_\mathbf{k} = \omega_{2\mathbf{K}^\mathrm{I}-\mathbf{k}} \neq \omega_{-\mathbf{k}}$, where $\mathbf{K}^\mathrm{I}$ is related to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya vectors. As a result of numerical investigations we find that the backscattering peak of a wave packet with initial wave vector $\mathbf{k}_0$ shifts from $-\mathbf{k}_0$ to $2\mathbf{K}^\mathrm{I}-\mathbf{k}_0$, such that the backscattering wave vector and the initial wave vector are in general no longer antiparallel. The shifted coherence condition is explained by a diagrammatic approach and opens up an avenue to measure sign and magnitude of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in weakly disordered chiral magnets.

"  In this work, we discuss the resonance states of a quantum particle in a periodic potential plus a static force. Originally this problem was formulated for a crystal electron subject to a static electric field and it is nowadays known as the Wannier-Stark problem. We describe a novel approach to the Wannier-Stark problem developed in recent years. This approach allows to compute the complex energy spectrum of a Wannier-Stark system as the poles of a rigorously constructed scattering matrix and solves the Wannier-Stark problem without any approximation. The suggested method is very efficient from the numerical point of view and has proven to be a powerful analytic tool for Wannier-Stark resonances appearing in different physical systems such as optical lattices or semiconductor superlattices.

"  We study the holographic renormalization group (RG) flow triggered by a classically marginal operator. When a marginal operator deforms a conformal field theory, it does not yield a nontrivial renormalization group flow at the classical level. At the quantum level, however, quantum corrections modify a marginal operator into one of the truly marginal, marginally relevant, and marginally irrelevant operators and can generate a nontrivial RG flow. We investigate the holographic description of a RG flow triggered by a marginal operator with quantum corrections. We look into how the physical quantities of a deformed theory, a coupling constant and the vacuum expectation value, rely on the RG scale. We further discuss the holographic description of the trace anomaly caused by the gluon condensation. ",Holographic RG flow triggered by a classically marginal operator
"  We study proximity effects at ferromagnet superconductor interfaces by self-consistent numerical solution of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations for the continuum, without any approximations. Our procedures allow us to study systems with long superconducting coherence lengths. We obtain results for the pair potential, the pair amplitude, and the local density of states. We use these results to extract the relevant proximity lengths. We find that the superconducting correlations in the ferromagnet exhibit a damped oscillatory behavior that is reflected in both the pair amplitude and the local density of states. The characteristic length scale of these oscillations is approximately inversely proportional to the exchange field, and is independent of the superconducting coherence length in the range studied. We find the superconducting coherence length to be nearly independent of the ferromagnetic polarization. ",Proximity effects at ferromagnet-superconductor interfaces
"  It is not always clear how to adjust for control data in causal inference, balancing the goals of reducing bias and variance. We show how, in a setting with repeated experiments, Bayesian hierarchical modeling yields an adaptive procedure that uses the data to determine how much adjustment to perform. The result is a novel analysis with increased statistical efficiency compared to the default analysis based on difference estimates. We demonstrate this procedure on two real examples, as well as on a series of simulated datasets. We show that the increased efficiency can have real-world consequences in terms of the conclusions that can be drawn from the experiments. We also discuss the relevance of this work to causal inference and statistical design and analysis more generally.

"  Photon correlations, as measured by Glauber's $n$-th order coherence functions $g^{(n)}$, are highly sought to be minimized and/or maximized. In systems that are coherently driven, so-called blockades can give rise to strong correlations according to two scenarios based on level-repulsion (conventional blockade) or interferences (unconventional blockade). Here we show how these two approaches relate to the admixing of a coherent state with a quantum state such as a squeezed state for the simplest and most recurrent case. The emission from a variety of systems, such as resonance fluorescence, the Jaynes-Cummings model or microcavity polaritons, as a few examples of a large family of quantum optical sources, are shown to be particular cases of such admixtures, that can further be doctored-up externally by adding an amplitude- and phase-controlled coherent field with the effect of tuning the photon statistics from exactly zero to infinity. We show how such an understanding also allows to classify photon statistics throughout platforms according to conventional and unconventional features, with the effect of optimizing the correlations and with possible spectroscopic applications. In particular, we show how configurations that can realize simultaneously conventional and unconventional antibunching bring the best of both worlds: huge antibunching (unconventional) with large populations and being robust to dephasing (conventional).

  We introduce a class of Lie algebras called admissible Lie algebras.

"  We show that the KLM scheme [Knill, Laflamme and Milburn, Nature {\bf 409}, 46] can be implemented using polarization encoding, thus reducing the number of path modes required by half. One of the main advantages of this new implementation is that it naturally incorporates a loss detection mechanism that makes the probability of a gate introducing a non-detected error, when non-ideal detectors are considered, dependent only on the detector dark-count rate and independent of its efficiency. Since very low dark-count rate detectors are currently available, a high-fidelity gate (probability of error of order $10^{-6}$ conditional on the gate being successful) can be implemented using polarization encoding. The detector efficiency determines the overall success probability of the gate but does not affect its fidelity. This can be applied to the efficient construction of optical cluster states with very high fidelity for quantum computing. ",High-fidelity linear optical quantum computing with polarization   encoding
  In this note we address the question of the $\theta$ dependence in non abelian gauge theories from a pure quantum information point of view. The main result is that the topological susceptibility is the quantum Fisher information of the ground state and that the maximally efficient quantum estimator of $\theta$ can be identified with the physical axion. In this setup the low energy dynamics of the axion is fully determined by quantum estimation theory. ,Topological susceptibility and information theory
"  Small discrete family symmetries such as S4, A4 or A5 may lead to simple leading-order predictions for the neutrino mixing matrix such as the bimaximal, tribimaximal or golden ratio mixing patterns, which may be brought into agreement with experimental data with the help of corrections from the charged-lepton sector. Such scenarios generally lead to relations among the parameters of the physical leptonic mixing matrix known as solar lepton mixing sum rules. In this article, we present a simple derivation of such solar sum rules, valid for arbitrary neutrino and charged lepton mixing angles and phases, assuming only {\theta}13^{\nu} = {\theta}13^e = 0. We discuss four leading-order neutrino mixing matrices with {\theta}13^{\nu} = 0 which are well motivated from family symmetry considerations. We then perform a phenomenological analysis of the scope to test the resulting four solar sum rules, highlighting the complementarity between next-generation neutrino oscillation experiments such as the reactor experiment JUNO and a superbeam experiment.

"  We propose the study of a conformally invariant functional for surfaces of complex projective plane which is closely related to the classical Willmore functional. We show that minimal surfaces of complex projective plane are critical for this functional and construct some minima for it via the twistors spaces of complex projective plane. Also, we find lower bounds for this functional and for its restriction to the class of Lagrangian surfaces and characterize the complex lines and the Lagrangian totally geodesic surfaces and the Whitney spheres as the only attaining those bounds.

"  In this paper, we propose FFCI, a framework for fine-grained summarization evaluation that comprises four elements: faithfulness (degree of factual consistency with the source), focus (precision of summary content relative to the reference), coverage (recall of summary content relative to the reference), and inter-sentential coherence (document fluency between adjacent sentences). We construct a novel dataset for focus, coverage, and inter-sentential coherence, and develop automatic methods for evaluating each of the four dimensions of FFCI based on cross-comparison of evaluation metrics and model-based evaluation methods, including question answering (QA) approaches, STS, next-sentence prediction (NSP), and scores derived from 19 pre-trained language models. We then apply the developed metrics in evaluating a broad range of summarization models across two datasets, with some surprising findings.

"  We propose a new algorithm for numerical path tracking in polynomial homotopy continuation. The algorithm is `robust' in the sense that it is designed to prevent path jumping and in many cases, it can be used in (only) double precision arithmetic. It is based on an adaptive stepsize predictor that uses Pad\'e techniques to detect local difficulties for function approximation and danger for path jumping. We show the potential of the new path tracking algorithm through several numerical examples and compare with existing implementations.

"  We study optimal user-network association in an integrated 802.11 WLAN and 3G-UMTS hybrid cell. Assuming saturated resource allocation on the downlink of WLAN and UMTS networks and a single QoS class of mobiles arriving at an average location in the hybrid cell, we formulate the problem with two different approaches: Global and Individual optimality. The Globally optimal association is formulated as an SMDP (Semi Markov Decision Process) connection routing decision problem where rewards comprise a financial gain component and an aggregate network throughput component. The corresponding Dynamic Programming equations are solved using Value Iteration method and a stationary optimal policy with neither convex nor concave type switching curve structure is obtained. Threshold type and symmetric switching curves are observed for the analogous homogenous network cases. The Individual optimality is studied under a non-cooperative dynamic game framework with expected service time of a mobile as the decision cost criteria. It is shown that individual optimality in a WLAN-UMTS hybrid cell, results in a threshold policy curve of descending staircase form with increasing Poisson arrival rate of mobiles.

"  In a nonequilibrium steady state, the violation of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT) is connected to breaking detailed balance. For the velocity correlations of a driven colloidal particle we calculate an explicit expression of the FDT violation. The equilibrium form of the FDT can be restored by measuring the velocity with respect to the local mean velocity. ",Restoring a fluctuation-dissipation theorem in a nonequilibrium steady   state
"  We investigate the spin-spin correlation functions of Ising magnets at complex values of the temperature, T. For one-dimensional chain and ladder systems, we show the existence of a kind of helimagnetic order in the vicinity of contours where the leading two eigenvalues of the transfer matrix become equal in magnitude. We analyse the development of long-range order as the two-dimensional limit is approached, and find that there is rich structure in much of the complex-T plane. In particular, and contrary to the work of Fisher on this problem, the development of long-range order is actually associated with a proliferation of partition function zeros in a certain finite region of that plane containing the real-temperature magnetically ordered phase. The thermodynamic consequences of this are also discussed. ",Correlations and phase structure of Ising models at complex temperature
"  The effective super-renormalizable 3-dimensional Lagrangian, describing the high temperature limit of chiral gauge theories, has more symmetry than the original 4d Lagrangian: parity violation is absent.

"  We consider the problem of constructing optimal designs for population pharmacokinetics which use random effect models. It is common practice in the design of experiments in such studies to assume uncorrelated errors for each subject. In the present paper a new approach is introduced to determine efficient designs for nonlinear least squares estimation which addresses the problem of correlation between observations corresponding to the same subject. We use asymptotic arguments to derive optimal design densities, and the designs for finite sample sizes are constructed from the quantiles of the corresponding optimal distribution function. It is demonstrated that compared to the optimal exact designs, whose determination is a hard numerical problem, these designs are very efficient. Alternatively, the designs derived from asymptotic theory could be used as starting designs for the numerical computation of exact optimal designs. Several examples of linear and nonlinear models are presented in order to illustrate the methodology. In particular, it is demonstrated that naively chosen equally spaced designs may lead to less accurate estimation.

"  The number of closed billiard trajectories in a rational-angled polygon grows quadratically in the length. This paper gives an analogue on K3 surfaces, by considering special Lagrangian tori. The analogue of the angle of a billiard trajectory is a point on a twistor sphere, and the number of directions admitting a special Lagrangian torus fibration with volume bounded by $ V $ grows like $ V^{20} $ with a power-saving term. Bergeron--Matheus have explicitly estimated the exponent of the error term as $ {20-\frac{4}{697633} }$. The counting result on K3 surfaces is deduced from a count of primitive isotropic vectors in indefinite lattices, which is in turn deduced from equidistribution results in homogeneous dynamics.

"  Basing on the general photon eigenstate and the anomaly cancelation, we have naturally explained the electric charge quantization in two models based on the SU(3)_C X SU(3)_L X U(1)_X gauge group, namely in the minimal model and in the model with right-handed neutrinos. In addition, we have shown that the electric charges of the proton and of the electron are opposite; and the same happens with the neutron and the neutrino. We argue that the electric charge quantization is not dependent on the classical constraints on generating mass to the fermions, but it is related closely with the generation number problem. In fact, both problems are properly solved as the direct consequences of the fermion content under the anomaly free conditions. ",Electric Charge Quantization in SU(3)_C X SU(3)_L X U(1)_X Models
"  The lines of lithium at 6708 A, and 6103 A, are analyzed in high resolution spectra of some sharp-lined and slowly rotating roAp stars. Three spectral synthesis codes - STARSP, ZEEMAN2 and SYNTHM were used. New lines of the rare earth elements from the DREAM database, and lines calculated on the basis of the NIST energy levels were included. Magnetic splitting and other line broadening processes were taken into account. Enhanced abundances of lithium in the atmospheres of the stars studied are obtained for both the lithium lines. High estimates of 6Li/7Li ratio (0.2 -- 0.5) for the studied star can be explained by Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR) production through the spallation reactions and the preservation of the original $^6$Li and $^7$Li by the strong magnetic fields.
